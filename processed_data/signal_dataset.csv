"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips What to do with $100,000? Where to invest that kind of money? These stocks to buy for 2024 include technology stocks, which continue to be a safe bet for growth-oriented investors. Of course, tech stocks are coming off their best year since the heady days of the internet bubble in 1999, with the Nasdaq index rising 43% in 2023. Despite the big rally, there’s still reason to be bullish on tech, semiconductor and microchip stocks in particular. These securities have a multi-year growth driver behind them in artificial intelligence (AI). While AI drove the Nasdaq higher last year, the technology is still in its infancy, and companies are only now starting to monetize it. Expect demand for AI microchips and semiconductors to continue growing as the technology changes the world. Here are three stocks to buy for the $100,000 portfolio: 2024 edition. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com Analysts at Stifel Financial (NYSE:SF) just upgraded their price target on shares of chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) from $145 to $170. The new price target implies a 20% upside for AMD stock from current levels after a 123% gain over the past 12 months. In December alone, AMD’s share price rose 20%. Stifel analysts cite AMD’s strong balance sheet and ties to secular trends such as AI as reasons to remain bullish on the stock. AMD stock has been a long-term winner for investors, gaining 650% over the past five years. The increase in 2023 was only about half the rise with rival chipmaker Nvidia‘s (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock; AMD has outpaced Nvidia over the past six months (24% vs. 12%) and appears to have momentum heading into 2024. AMD’s executives have also clarified that they are going all-in on AI, recently launching a new series of microchips called the “Ryzen 8040,” specifically for AI applications. Cadence Design Systems (CDNS) Source: mrinalpal / Shutterstock.com Now for a technology stock that most investors are likely unfamiliar with—Cadence Design Systems (NASDAQ:CDNS). Based in Silicon Valley and an ongoing concern since 1988, Cadence produces the software, hardware, and silicon pieces for designing and building integrated circuits, microchips and circuit boards. Think of them as creating the nuts and bolts of the microchip industry. While Cadence Design gets little attention, its stock is up 66% over the past 12 months and 510% over five years. Heading into 2024, Cadence Design Systems could be a good way to play the rally in chip and semiconductor stocks. The company’s earnings remain strong, and it has forecasted full-year 2023 revenue growth of 15% year-over-year and earnings per share (EPS) growth of 20%. Cadence is also flush with cash of $962 million and long-term debt of $649 million at the end of Q3 2023. CDNS stock isn’t cheap, trading at 75 times future earnings estimates, but the stock’s performance justifies the premium price. Micron Technology (MU) Source: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com Sticking with chipmakers, we have Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU). Its stock is up 12% in the past month after the company posted better-than-expected quarterly results. Over the last 12 months, MU stock has risen 66%, up 155% through five years. Not yet profitable, Micron reported a loss of $0.95 a share for its fiscal first quarter, which was better than the expected loss of $1.01 on Wall Street. Revenue totaled $4.73 billion, which beat analysts’ forecasts of $4.58 billion. Micron is a leader in dynamic random-access memory chips for desktop computers and servers, and flash memory in smartphones and hard drives. During itsearnings call the company’s management team gave a bullish outlook for AI, saying the technology should drive “multiyear growth.” Micron also said that inventory levels for its memory and storage chips are normal, and it’s working with Nvidia on upcoming AI chips—all music to investors’ ears. On the date of publication, Joel Baglole held long positions in NVDA and CDNS. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.

"Wall Street closed mixed on Tuesday, dragged down by tech and consumer discretionary stocks. The yield on the U.S. 10-year Treasury Note climbed to a two-week high. Two of the three major stock indexes ended in the red, while one ended in the green. How Did the Benchmarks Perform? The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) rose 25.5 points, or 0.1%, to close at 37,715.54. Eighteen components of the 30-stock index ended in positive territory, while 12 ended in positive. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite dropped 245.41 points, or 1.6%, to close at 14,765.94. The S&P 500 slid 27 points, or 0.6%, to close at 4,742.83. Five of the 11 broad sectors of the benchmark index closed in the red. The Technology Select Sector SPDR (XLK), the Industrials Select Sector SPDR (XLI) and the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR (XLY) declined 2.6%, 1% and 0.9%, respectively, while the Health Care Select Sector SPDR (XLV) advanced 1.8%. The fear-gauge CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) decreased 6% to 13.20. A total of 11.9 billion shares were traded on Tuesday, lower than the last 20-session average of 12.4 billion. Apple (AAPL) Weighs Down on the Tech Sector Shares of Apple Inc. AAPL declined 3.6% after Barclays downgraded the tech behemoth’s rating to “underweight”. The analysts cited weakening demand for the company’s flagship mobile iPhone 15 and almost zero upgrades to the iPhone 16 model as the main reason. Demand has been a major concern for the company since early 2023, and its holiday season sales forecast has also been below Wall Street estimates. Apple has also struggled in China’s market since the resurgence of Huawei. Being one of the “Magnificent Seven” stocks, Apple’s plight weighed down on the tech sector and the broader market in general. Consequently, shares of Microsoft Corporation MSFT and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. AMD fell 1.4% and 6%, respectively. Microsoft carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. 10-Year Treasury Yield Touches 2-Week High On Tuesday, the U.S. benchmark 10-year treasury yield climbed above the 4% mark to touch a 2-week high before settling at 3.937%. When treasury yields go up, future valuations of mega-cap growth stocks like tech seem unreasonable, and it weighs on the sector. Economic Data The U.S. Census Bureau reported that construction spending for November had increased 0.4% as opposed to a consensus of 0.6% for the period. The increase for October was revised up to 1.2% from the previously reported 0.6%.

"Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock. Shares of this chipmaker have returned +17.1% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +4% change. The Zacks Electronics - Semiconductors industry, to which Advanced Micro belongs, has gained 14.6% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term? While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making. Revisions to Earnings Estimates Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings. Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements. Advanced Micro is expected to post earnings of $0.77 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +11.6%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -1.6%. The consensus earnings estimate of $2.65 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -24.3%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.63 indicates a change of +37% from what Advanced Micro is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.4%. With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for Advanced Micro. The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate: 12 Month EPS Revenue Growth Forecast While earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth. For Advanced Micro, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $6.11 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +9.2%. For the current and next fiscal years, $22.63 billion and $26.06 billion estimates indicate -4.1% and +15.2% changes, respectively. Last Reported Results and Surprise History Advanced Micro reported revenues of $5.8 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +4.2%. EPS of $0.70 for the same period compares with $0.67 a year ago. Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.71 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.65%. The EPS surprise was +2.94%. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period. Valuation No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance. Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is. As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued. Advanced Micro is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade. Conclusion The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Advanced Micro. However, its Zacks Rank #4 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term. Zacks Names #1 Semiconductor Stock It's only 1/9,000th the size of NVIDIA which skyrocketed more than +800% since we recommended it. NVIDIA is still strong, but our new top chip stock has much more room to boom. With strong earnings growth and an expanding customer base, it's positioned to feed the rampant demand for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Internet of Things. Global semiconductor manufacturing is projected to explode from $452 billion in 2021 to $803 billion by 2028.

"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock was arguably the most important one on the market in 2023. Due to its weighting in the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 indices, it had a significant impact on their performance. Both set new all-time highs last year. Nvidia stock gained nearly 240% last year. It was the fifth largest and the second most influential component in the S&P 500 behind Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) It also was the fourth largest and the most influential component of the Nasdaq 100, just ahead of Tesla. The chip maker reached a $1 trillion valuation as a result. Now it’s a matter of when, not if, it hits $2 trillion. The Bull Case for Nvidia As the leading semiconductor company specializing in graphics cards and data centers, AI energized Nvidia’s performance. Its future performance in 2024 depends heavily on ongoing chip demand, its ability to innovate to maintain a competitive advantage, and whether AI has the legs to keep running higher. There is an excellent case that demand should grow. Businesses want in on AI, which ought to keep Nvidia busy. And PC sales could rebound with the potential for an AI PC being introduced this year. And the gaming market where Nvidia cut its teeth is showing signs of growth once more. Higher console sales, more games sold, and an increased number of players point to a recovery in the industry. Nvidia’s Q3 gaming revenue jumped 15% sequentially and 81% year over year. There is plenty Nvidia is doing right, too. Because Arm Holdings (NASDAQ:ARM) technology is so critical to its own, Nvidia invested in Arm’s IPO. Regulators prevented the two from merging over antitrust concerns, so this backdoor way of ensuring its access is the next best thing. Nvidia’s recently released Grace Hopper H200 AI Superchip is based on Arm’s architecture. The Bear Case for Nvidia NVDA stock already embodies the belief all that will fall in the chip maker’s favor. The stock is priced for perfection. Although only trading for 24 times next year’s earnings, it also goes for 27 times sales and 70 times free cash flow. With the U.S. blocking the sale and transfer of technology and chips to China and competitors nipping at its AI heels, any hiccup could cause NVDA stock to tumble. The country represents 20% of Nvidia’s data center revenue, one of its most important segments. Nvidia quickly established itself as the leading AI chip stock but Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and more recently Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) released competing processors. The H200 puts Nvidia back in the lead, but does so at a much higher price. Discounting by rivals could jeopardize NVDA’s lead. While the gaming market did bounce, the PC segment is still in decline. An AI PC might help, but that could be wishful thinking too. According to analysts, Nvidia has a median 12-month price target of $650, implying 35% upside in the stock. At least one analyst forecasts Nvidia stock will hit $1,100 per share, more than doubling from its current price of $495 per share. These optimistic projections are based on the assumption that Nvidia will continue to dominate the AI market, which is expected to grow at a 40.2% compounded annual growth rate between 2020 to 2027. The question is, how long is AI’s growth sustainable? Right now it’s on a rocket ride but that’s based on it continuing to pay dividends for business. If the hoped-for savings and efficiencies don’t materialize, that could cause demand to drop off the table. The Verdict on NVDA Stock Although momentum is in Nvidia’s favor, the stock is not a clear buy in 2024. It will be hard to keep the pace of growth going. The clarity needed regarding China is not imminent. Competition is growing and becoming more intense, particularly on the AI side. AI could be a bubble that bursts in 2024 due to regulatory, ethical, or social concerns. Yet I wouldn’t be selling shares either. Rather, for investors willing to tolerate the volatility and uncertainty in the market, the chip maker is a hold. Nvidia is a great company with a strong competitive advantage, but its stock is trading at a significant premium. With the saturation of its core markets, I’d be leery of buying more now On the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

"The video games market is vast, encompassing a wide range from consoles to PCs, mobile games, handheld devices, and more. Meanwhile, recent developments like microtransactions and subscription-based services have opened new ways for companies to boost revenue. According to Statista, the industry is valued at about $250 billion, and is expected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of about 9% through 2028. As a result, it's not a bad idea to make a long-term investment in the market and profit from its consistent development. After all, there's a reason many of the world's most valuable companies, including Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), Nvidia, and Apple, ventured into the lucrative arena. No matter the economic climate, there is almost always demand for new gaming content and hardware upgrades, offering companies and their investors reliable gains over the long term. Here are three top gaming stocks to buy in January. 1. Advanced Micro Devices Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) are up 127% over the last 12 months as the company impressed Wall Street with its artificial intelligence (AI) efforts. However, long before the company's venture into AI, AMD was a crucial fixture in the gaming community. The tech giant's computing hardware, including graphics processing units (GPUs) and central processing units (CPUs), is used by gamers worldwide to build high-powered gaming PCs. AMD's chips allow consumers to play demanding titles at far higher settings than possible on consoles. However, that hasn't stopped the company from also carving out a lucrative role in the console market. AMD is the exclusive supplier of chips to Sony's PlayStation 5 and Microsoft's Xbox Series X|S, two of the best-selling consoles of the last few years. AMD's success in video gaming pushed revenue in its gaming segment rise 30% to $1.5 billion over the last five years, with operating income up 72% to $208 million. Data by YCharts AMD looks too expensive with a forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 55. However, this table shows AMD's earnings could hit $5 per share by fiscal 2025. Multiplying that figure by the company's forward P/E gives a stock price of $275, projecting growth of 87% over the next two fiscal years. And with that, AMD is an attractive way to invest in gaming this month. 2. Microsoft As the home of the Xbox, Microsoft is one of the biggest names in video games. The company launched the brand with its first console in 2001, debuting as an underdog in an industry long dominated by Japanese firms Sony and Nintendo. However, Microsoft played to its strengths, using its skills in software to approach the market in a unique way. The tech giant was one of the first to launch a video game subscription service with Xbox Game Pass, which landed on the scene in 2017 and has been described as the Netflix for games. Game Pass made Xbox the best-valued console available, allowing gamers to pay one low monthly fee for access to an extensive library of new and old titles rather than paying for games individually. From 2020 to 2022, the number of Game Pass members rose 150% to 25 million. The platform's success has occurred as Microsoft acquired several game developers to boost content on the service, including purchasing Activision Blizzard (creators of Call of Duty) in 2023. Microsoft's forward P/E of 33 makes its stock a pricey option. However, as a behemoth in the video games industry, and free cash flow that hit $63 billion in 2023, the company has earned its premium price and is an attractive way to invest in video games this month. 3. Intel Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) might not be the first company that comes to mind in a discussion about gaming. However, like AMD, the chipmaker's CPUs have been heartily adopted by the video game community to run powerful gaming PCs. Additionally, in 2022, Intel took steps to diversify its position in gaming with the launch of its first consumer GPUs. Their debut had unfortunate timing, as macroeconomic headwinds had brought down the entire market. However, easing inflation last year suggests gaming GPU demand might be trending up again. In the third quarter of 2023, Intel's client computing segment (which includes gaming income) posted operating income growth of 43% to $2 billion. The company is on a promising growth trajectory, with excellent prospects in video games over the long term. Data by YCharts This chart shows Intel's earnings are projected to reach almost $3 per share over the next two fiscal years. In a similar calculation to AMD, multiplying the figure by Intel's forward P/E of 53 yields a stock price of $140. Considering the company's current position, its shares are projected to deliver growth of 180% by fiscal 2025. Intel could be one of the smartest ways to invest in video games this January.

"The artificial intelligence (AI) market exploded last year, becoming one of the fastest-growing industries. Data from Grand View Research shows the AI market is projected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of 37% through 2030, which would see it exceed a value of $1 trillion before the end of the decade. So it's no surprise that companies worldwide have restructured their businesses to focus on the budding sector, presenting a variety of investment opportunities. Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) are some of the most attractive options, with one making moves in AI chips and the other heavily investing in the software side of the industry. So let's take a look at whether AMD or Microsoft is currently the better stock for those who want to back the rapidly expanding AI market. Advanced Micro Devices Since its founding more than 50 years ago, AMD has become one of the biggest threats in chips. The company hasn't always been first to a market but has proven its ability to carve out a lucrative position in almost any part of the industry with its advanced technology and decisive leadership. AMD CEO Lisa Su took the helm in October 2014. Since then, the company's shares have soared over 4,000% as it has become a leader in central and graphics processing units (CPUs and GPUs). In fact, AMD's CPU market share has risen from 18% in 2017 to 35% in 2023, gradually chipping away at Intel's share. Meanwhile, the tech giant has attained a significant share of desktop GPUs, second only to Nvidia. As a result, AMD's expansion into AI strengthens its long-term outlook. Nvidia might have an estimated 90% market share in AI chips, but AMD's past performance suggests it will be able to secure a powerful role in the sector. AMD will begin shipping its MI300X GPU this year, designed specifically to challenge Nvidia's offerings. The AI chip already has Microsoft's Azure signed on as a customer, with AMD in talks with several other tech companies. It's still early days for AMD's AI journey, but it's likely to go far in the market in the coming years. Microsoft Microsoft got a head start in AI, investing $1 billion in ChatGPT developer OpenAI in 2019. The company has since increased that investment significantly and now boasts a 49% stake in the start-up. Microsoft's partnership with OpenAI has granted it access to some of the most advanced AI models, giving it an edge over rivals like Amazon and Alphabet. The Windows company has used OpenAI's technology to bring AI upgrades across its product lineup. Its cloud platform, Azure, has expanded its range of AI tools, search engine Bing has been improved with ChatGPT-like features, and various Office productivity services now promise to boost efficiency with the help of AI. Meanwhile, Microsoft has delivered impressive quarterly earnings. In the first quarter of 2024 (ending September 2023), the company posted revenue growth of 13% year over year, beating Wall Street forecasts by nearly $2 billion. Gains came from considerable growth in its productivity and cloud-related segments, which saw revenue increase by 13% and 19%, respectively. As the home of brands like Windows, Office, Azure, Xbox, and LinkedIn, Microsoft has a massive user base. Millions of businesses rely on its software, presenting considerable earning opportunities in AI. Is AMD or Microsoft the better AI stock? AMD and Microsoft have solid outlooks in AI over the long term. AMD looks poised to shake up the chip market with the launch of its new GPU. Meanwhile, Microsoft has the tech and brand loyalty to become the go-to for anyone looking to integrate AI into their workflow. However, the charts below suggest AMD might have more stock growth potential over the next two fiscal years. Data by YCharts These tables compare AMD's and Microsoft's EPS estimates for the next two fiscal years. According to the data, AMD's earnings could hit $5 per share by fiscal 2026, while Microsoft's will likely reach $15 per share. On the surface, Microsoft looks like a no-brainer. Yet multiplying those figures by AMD's forward price-to-earnings ratio of 55 and Microsoft's 34 yields stock prices of $275 and $510, respectively. Looking at their current positions, AMD's share would rise 87% and Microsoft's 36% over the next two fiscal years. As a result, AMD looks like the better AI stock right now and an attractive buy at the start of 2024. Should you invest $1,000 in Advanced Micro Devices right now?

"Chip stocks, including Nvidia (NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) have been on an absolute tear over the last 12 months, as investors remain extremely bullish on the artificial intelligence (AI) megatrend. Both AMD and Nvidia manufacture specialized chips that help power data centers for multiple AI platforms. While Nvidia stock more than tripled in 2023, AMD stock gained 127.6% last year. www.barchart.com However, a new analyst note today warns that NVDA could be vulnerable this year as the AI hype cycle tumbles into the so-called “trough of disillusionment” phase. With tech giants taking a dive to start the new year, let’s see which semiconductor stock has more upside potential for investors right now. The Bull Case for NVDA Stock Nvidia is well-positioned to benefit from the adoption of generative AI in the upcoming decade. In fiscal Q3 of 2024 (ended in October), Nvidia reported sales of $18.1 billion, an increase of 206% year over year. The majority of these gains were driven by Nvidia’s data center segment. Despite its massive size, analysts expect the company to increase sales by 118.4% to $59 billion in fiscal 2024 (ending in January) and by 56.5% to $92.3 billion in fiscal 2025. Comparatively, adjusted earnings per share are forecast to grow by 102.5% annually in the next five years. So, priced at 24.2 times forward earnings, NVDA stock is still quite cheap, given its stellar growth estimates. Market research company Gartner (IT) forecasts AI chip sales to surge to $67 billion in 2024, an increase of 25% year over year. Nvidia currently has a market share of almost 80% in this vertical, which means the business should generate revenue of around $54 billion in the next 12 months. These numbers could easily move higher if demand for AI chips continues to grow at an exponential rate. Out of the 35 analysts covering NVDA stock, 30 recommend “strong buy,” three recommend “moderate buy,” and two recommend “hold.” The average target price for NVDA is $653, indicating an upside potential of 37% from current levels. www.barchart.com The Bull Case for AMD Stock Valued at $221.7 billion by market cap, AMD has been among the hottest tech stocks in the past decade, rising a whopping 3,710% since January 2014. AMD’s CEO, Lisa Su, forecasts the data center AI chip vertical to grow from $45 billion in 2023 to $400 billion in 2027, providing it with enough room to grow its top line in the next four years. In addition to AI, AMD is poised to benefit from growth in its legacy businesses, such as graphics and enterprise processors. Similar to several other tech stocks, AMD wrestled with slowing PC sales, higher costs, elevated interest rates, and lower enterprise spending. It also faced challenges in China, due to restrictions on exports by the U.S. government. Due to a challenging macro environment, AMD’s sales are forecast to decline by 4% year over year to $22.65 billion in 2023. However, revenue might rise by 16.6% to $26.4 billion in 2024. Comparatively, adjusted earnings per share is forecast to expand from $2.65 in 2023 to $3.73 in 2024. Priced at 39.5 times forward earnings, AMD trades at a much higher multiple compared to NVDA. However, it's growing at a much slower pace. Out of the 29 analysts covering AMD stock, 23 recommend “strong buy,” one recommends “moderate buy,” and five recommend “hold.” However, the average target price for AMD is $135.07, which is fractionally below the stock's current levels - suggesting that Wall Street sees more upside ahead for NVDA relative to AMD over the next year. www.barchart.com On the date of publication, Aditya Raghunath did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips The semiconductor industry took the world by storm in 2023, and I believe it will continue to remain a highlight of this year too. It is hard to imagine a world without semiconductor chips, and if you want to make the most of the ample potential these companies have, it is best to invest in semiconductor stocks. You should especially consider the hottest semiconductor stocks that we have listed here! Analysts expect a steady expansion of this industry, and as the economy improves, we could see companies report stellar financials. This is still an early stage for the industry and it has many years of growth. So, if you haven’t had a chance to buy Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock before it soared by more than 200%, you can still look for the hottest semiconductor stocks that have solid long-term potential. Let’s take a look at them. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is Nvidia’s biggest competitor and it is taking giant strides in the industry. While 2023 may not have been a blockbuster year for the company, it is set to rebound this year. It is expected that PC sales will rise again, and we could see AMD report better sales revenue from the same since the company supplies chips for PCs. Additionally, the third quarter revenue was up 8% quarter over quarter, and the EPS was up 21%. This shows that the company is gaining ground and improving its business performance. Top tech giants including Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) have announced the adoption of AMD’s chips and this is a strong shift from Nvidia’s chips. That said, companies not willing to wait for weeks to get their hands on Nvidia chips will be happy to use AMD’s latest AI chips. AMD stock is up over 100% in the year and has generated more than 600% returns in the past five years. This speaks a lot about the strength of the business to survive amidst all market conditions. Trading at $135 today, the stock looks undervalued to me. Stifel Financial (NYSE:SF) analyst has upgraded the price target for the stock from $145 to $170 and this shows a 20% upside from the current level. AMD has everything it takes to be a long-term investment. It has a solid history, exceptional leadership, and the ability to survive any storm. As the demand for PCs improves, we could see AMD report impressive numbers. It can be a long-term winner, but you must have the patience to hold on to it. Intel (INTC) Source: Kate Krav-Rude / Shutterstock.com A hot semiconductor stock for 2024, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) benefits from the CHIPS Act. However, it hasn’t been able to impress investors with the financials. However, this year could be different. The company will launch Gaudi 3, an AI accelerator that is expected to beat Nvidia’s chips in data centers. Additionally, the company launched an independent AI company, Articul8 AI, in collaboration with DigitalBridge Group. The company will offer secure and cost-effective AI solutions to enterprises. Financial details about the company aren’t disclosed yet, but this move can help Intel expand its market share. While Intel has been late to enter the AI race, if the chips are worth the hype, we could see a strong improvement in Intel’s business. The company has been around for a while and they do know how to run a business, but the AI industry is getting highly competitive, and it is time to prove their worth. The company is also expanding its manufacturing facility in Ireland and Oregon. INTC stock is up 69% in the year but relatively flat in the past five years. I believe the company will be able to sustain the current momentum, and we could see a slow but steady upside from the current level of $47. Stifel Financial analyst also increased the price target from $38 to $45 and has a hold rating on the stock. The analyst finds the semiconductor stock attractive as we head into 2024. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com A well-known name in the semiconductor industry, Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSMC) is one of the hottest semiconductor stocks to own. It makes chips for the biggest tech giants including Nvidia, and holds more than 50% of the market share in the semiconductor space. It benefits from the CHIPS Act and is building a plant in Arizona to make the most of it. While this has impacted the earnings, it still has an upside potential. As the world’s leading semiconductor foundry, TSMC has the expertise and leadership to continue expanding its market share. One big reason to invest in the stock is that the company doesn’t produce chips for general sale but caters to other companies to meet their needs. This means it will have a steady revenue flow throughout the year. If the demand for PCs and smartphones improves, the company could see a significant improvement in the chip demand. The stock is up 31% in the year and is exchanging hands for $100. I believe TSMC is a long-term stock to buy and hold.

"2023 was the year of artificial intelligence (AI) investing, and perhaps the biggest winners were the ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks, a moniker that includes mega-cap behemoths Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Nvidia, Tesla, and Meta Platforms. One of the biggest standouts among this cohort was semiconductor company Nvidia, which saw its market cap balloon to more than $1 trillion, fueled by unprecedented demand for chips used to train generative AI models. While each of the companies above has a multitude of ways to benefit from AI tailwinds, savvy investors should know that myriad opportunities exist in the capital markets. One such company that looks set up to dominate in 2024 is Nvidia's top rival, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD). While the company's growth in 2023 paled in comparison to Nvidia's, AMD may have just made its best countermove yet, setting up 2024 to be a milestone year. Let's dig into what AMD has in the cards, and why scooping up shares now could be a lucrative opportunity. AMD's answer to Nvidia In early December, AMD released a new line of AI chips. The cornerstone of the product release was the MI300X, AMD's biggest answer yet to Nvidia's unrelenting graphics processing units (GPUs) operation. During the unveiling, AMD's CEO Lisa Su made a bold declaration when she called the MI300X ""the most advanced AI accelerator in the industry."" If that doesn't get you excited, let's check out some of the use cases around the MI300X accelerator that support Su's high degree of confidence. Microsoft is going to use the MI300X for applications in its leading cloud platform Azure, a strategy that could further propel the dominance of ChatGPT. Remember, Microsoft previously made a massive $10 billion investment in OpenAI, the parent company of ChatGPT. Moreover, with the release of its new CoPilot offering, Microsoft's plans to integrate ChatGPT throughout its ecosystem are becoming increasingly clear. Therefore, it's likely the Windows developer will be highly selective with its vendor partners to ensure its massive investments in AI pay off. Another noteworthy partnership includes Meta, which announced that it will be using the MI300X for AI inferencing. This is important because these use cases could be early indications that AMD's newest chips will be a bellwether for data center business -- a market that is largely dominated by Nvidia right now. Image Source: Getty Images How much growth can AMD expect? Following the public release of the MI300X, Su sat down with CNBC to speak in more detail about how these chips could represent the next frontier of growth. More specifically, Su said that she believes the addressable market for data center AI accelerators will reach $400 billion by 2027. To put this figure in perspective, during AMD's Q3 earnings call management guided for $2 billion in data center GPU revenue for 2024. Although this looks like a low forecast relative to the potential size of the market, I'm not worried for AMD. Given the sky-high demand for Nvidia's GPUs, the company has made significant investments in manufacturing and production. I see this as an opportunity for AMD to make inroads in the data center AI market and acquire additional market share. Why? Because as Nvidia's backlog continues to grow, I see customers diversifying their GPU needs and turning to more than one provider. So while Nvidia may dominate the space right now, I think AMD has a greenfield opportunity to provide customers with commensurate (if not superior) technology, and do so at a potentially lower cost and faster delivery time. For this reason, I see AMD's forecast of $2 billion in data center GPU revenue to be conservative. Furthermore, I am incredibly bullish that this figure could grow exponentially in just a few years. Is AMD stock going parabolic? AMD stock rocketed 123% during 2023. Yet Hans Mosesmann of Rosenblatt Securities sees another 45% upside for AMD stock, giving it a price target of $200. Don't worry too much about whether AMD reaches or exceeds this price target in 2024. Rather, ask yourself if you believe in the long-term secular trend of AI, and if AMD is well positioned to benefit. I think the MI300X came at just the right time. While Nvidia is the dominant player in AI GPUs, AMD has a unique opportunity to capitalize on unprecedented demand in the data center space in particular. Investors should view AI as more of a marathon than a sprint, keeping in mind that AMD spent a good portion of 2023 making strategic acquisitions, which haven't been fully integrated or monetized yet. So while AMD's current growth is not as exciting as that of its larger counterpart, its roadmap is hard to ignore. Moreover, as various applications for GPU technology begin to take shape, I see AMD emerging as a formidable leader in the space. If you're looking for alternatives to Nvidia or seeking hedges to other AI plays in your portfolio, I wouldn't sleep on AMD. In fact, given the early positive indications of MI300X's demand, 2024 could end up being a massive year for the chip company, and represent the beginning of a long-term strong force in data center AI.

"By Johann M Cherian and Shristi Achar A Jan 4 (Reuters) - Wall Street rose on Thursday, boosted by gains in financial stocks, while strong jobs data prompted investors to tweak their expectations of how early interest-rate cuts could begin. The recovery in the three main U.S. stock indexes follows a downbeat start to 2024, with the S&P 500 .SPX notching its worst two-day performance since late October as investors booked profits after a blistering rally last year. Bets that the Federal Reserve could start reducing interest rates this year had driven much of the gains towards the end of 2023, though the latest minutes from the central bank's December policy meeting did not offer many clues on when the easing might commence. Traders see a 66.4% chance for at least a 25-basis point (bps) rate cut in March and a near 93% probability for May, according to the CME Group's FedWatch tool. Financials .SPSY led gains among the S&P 500 sectors with a 1.1% rise, underpinned by a 3.4% advance in Allstate ALL.N after Morgan Stanley lifted its rating on the insurer to ""overweight"". An ADP National Employment report showed U.S. private employers hired more workers than expected in December, pointing to persistent strength in the labor market that should continue to sustain the economy. Private payrolls increased by 164,000 in December, compared with a 101,000 rise the month before. The report comes ahead of the official employment data due on Friday. ""Today's numbers were a little muted, they weren't something that says, we need to cut rates tomorrow,"" said Joe Saluzzi, co-manager of trading at Themis Trading in Chatham, New Jersey. ""So what you're seeing is people resetting expectations as to when those rate cuts will start."" Separately, a weekly Labor Department report showed more Americans filed for state unemployment claims than expected. Yields on longer-dated U.S. Treasury tenors rose after the data, with the yield on the benchmark 10-year note US10YT=RR climbing to 3.9761%. US/ Investors also assessed the S&P Global's final reading of composite PMI data for December at 50.9, compared with a preliminary reading of 51.0.

"For a Reuters live blog on U.S., UK and European stock markets, click LIVE/ or type LIVE/ in a news window. Futures up: Dow 0.09%, S&P 0.06%, Nasdaq 0.11% Jan 4 (Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures ticked up on Thursday, recovering from a grim start to the new year, as investors awaited more economic data for cues on the Federal Reserve's monetary easing path, while Apple slipped following a rating downgrade. Wall Street stumbled in the first two sessions of 2024, with the benchmark S&P 500 .SPX notching its worst two-day performance since late-October as investors booked profits after a blistering rally last year. Hopes that the Fed could start interest rate cuts this year had driven much of the gains towards the end of 2023, though the latest minutes from the central bank's December policy meeting did not offer many clues on when the easing might commence. Traders now see a 72.6% chance for at least a 25 basis points (bps) rate cut in March and a near 96% probability for May. Yields on U.S. Treasury tenors, an indicator of interest rate expectations, edged up, with the yield on the benchmark 10-year note US10YT=RR climbing to 3.955%. US/ Investors now await the ADP National Employment Report due at 8:15 a.m. ET, ahead of a key jobs report on Friday, both of which could shed some light on the health of the labor market and influence expectations on the rate trajectory. Economists polled by Reuters expect private payrolls to have increased by 115,000 in December, from a 103,000 rise the month before. Also on tap are initial jobless claims data for the week ended Dec. 30 and December S&P services sector activity data.

"Party like it's 1999: That's what many stocks in the Nasdaq-100 did in 2023. The index delivered its biggest gains since the end of the 20th century, skyrocketing nearly 54%. The sizzling momentum could fade for some Nasdaq stocks. Others, though, could keep the good times rolling, and some laggards could rebound, based on analysts' projections. Here are three Nasdaq-100 stocks Wall Street thinks will soar another 29% or more in 2024. 1. Warner Bros. Discovery Warner Bros. Discovery (NASDAQ: WBD) started 2023 with a bang, with its shares jumping as much as 68% by late February. Although the stock subsequently gave up much of those early gains, it still ended the year up 20%. Several analysts look for Warner Bros. Discovery to bounce back in 2024. The average 12-month price target is 36% above the company's current share price. The big story for Warner Bros. Discovery right now is its discussions about a potential merger with Paramount Global. A combination of the two companies would create an entertainment giant but would also increase Warner Bros. Discovery's debt load. With Warner's total debt already approaching $45 billion, it's understandable why investors aren't exactly enamored with the idea of a merger with Paramount. Should a deal be announced, we could see some revisions to Wall Street's price targets. 2. Nvidia Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) ranked as the hottest Nasdaq-100 stock last year. Shares of the chipmaker more than tripled on surging demand for its graphics processing units (GPUs). Wall Street doesn't expect Nvidia to keep up that torrid pace in 2024. But analysts nonetheless anticipate another great performance. The consensus 12-month price target reflects an upside potential of 33%. The boom in generative artificial intelligence (AI) shows no signs of ending anytime soon. That should translate into sustained demand for Nvidia's GPUs, which are widely viewed as the gold standard for powering AI apps. There's one potential fly in the ointment, though. Rivals including Advanced Micro Devices and customers such as Alphabet's Google Cloud are rolling out their own powerful AI chips. Nvidia's almost total dominance of the market might come to an end in the not-too-distant future. 3. PayPal Holdings Not every Nasdaq-100 stock was a solid winner in 2023. PayPal Holdings' (NASDAQ: PYPL) shares sank nearly 14% last year after plunging 62% in 2022. The fintech pioneer could have a light at the end of the tunnel, though, if Wall Street is right. The average analysts' 12-month price target for PayPal is more than 29% above the current share price. Despite the dismal stock performance in recent years, PayPal's underlying business appears to be in pretty good shape. The company's net revenue rose 8% year over year in the third quarter of 2023. Adjusted earnings per share soared 20%. Total payment volume jumped 15%. There's still uncertainty for PayPal, though. The company has a new leadership team. Competition in the digital payments market is intensifying. Its business loans portfolio has deteriorated. But with a price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio of only 0.51, PayPal's valuation looks quite attractive and reflects analysts' expectations of more robust growth in the future.

"The graphics card market is no longer a duopoly. Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) launched its first discrete family of graphics cards in late 2022. While the launch was bumpy, the company managed to offer a compelling value proposition for gamers in the budget portion of the market. Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is still the market leader by far, and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) is in a distant second place. Intel has gained a small foothold, but only in the budget portion of the market. The company's issues with buggy software drivers, particularly soon after launch, have likely driven some gamers away. Another shot in 2024 Intel's first generation of graphics cards made no attempt to compete with Nvidia and AMD at higher price points. The Arc A750 sells today for around $210, and the Arc A770 goes for around $320, although prices have dipped lower at times. These cards are competitive for the price, although performance can be inconsistent due to nagging driver issues. Helping Intel in 2023 were lackluster mid-range graphics card launches from both Nvidia and AMD. Nvidia's RTX 4060 and RTX 4060 Ti came with limitations and high price tags. Tom's Hardware concluded that the priciest variant was ""overpriced for what you get, much like most of the rest of Nvidia's current RTX 40-series lineup."" AMD's efforts weren't much better. The RX 7600 wasn't much of an upgrade over previous models, and the value proposition, compared to last-gen products, was weak, even after a last-minute price cut. While Nvidia is expected to roll out a product refresh soon, genuinely new mid-range graphics cards from Nvidia and AMD likely won't be coming until 2025. The gap between Nvidia's RTX 3060 and RTX 4060 was more than two years, and the RTX 4060 has only been on the market since mid-2023. AMD may fill in some gaps in its lineup in 2024, but next-generation products are likely a ways off. Intel's next-generation graphics cards, codenamed Battlemage, are expected to arrive sometime in 2024. With Battlemage, Intel is expected to move up into the enthusiast portions of the market that its first-generation products avoided. While Intel probably won't be going toe-to-toe with Nvidia's highest-end products, Battlemage should appeal to a broader swath of gamers. Intel proved with its first-generation products that it can produce capable graphics hardware. With its second-generation products, it must prove that it's committed enough to the market to continually improve its software and eliminate the bugs and inconsistencies that have been holding it back. A multibillion-dollar opportunity Jon Peddie Research expects the market for discrete graphics cards to grow to $39 billion by 2026. That estimate was thrown out in late 2022 before the artificial intelligence (AI) bonanza caused demand for data center GPUs to explode. Considering just the market for graphics cards aimed at gaming, however, that's likely still a reasonable estimate. In addition to winning a portion of the graphics card market, Intel's increased work on graphics can benefit it in other ways. The company's Meteor Lake CPUs, which launched in December for laptops, feature revamped integrated GPUs that deliver enormous performance gains. One set of benchmarks, for example, shows a 33% performance gain and a doubling of power efficiency over previous-generation models. Intel has long lagged AMD in terms of integrated graphics performance, but that gap now appears to be closing. While Intel's initial graphics card launch didn't go smoothly, the software situation has greatly improved over the past year. Whenever the company manages to get Battlemage out the door, it will be in a good position to increase its market share and cement its status as a viable alternative to Nvidia and AMD.

"Server and storage system manufacturer Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI) has gone from an under-followed value stock to a top pick among investors looking to bet on artificial intelligence (AI). 2023 was an excellent year: The stock soared nearly 250% higher. By all indications, Super Micro could still be a great value right now. But I'm passing once again on this data center and enterprise compute manufacturer. Here are three reasons why. 1. Super Micro is sitting on a massive opportunity, but so is everyone else Super Micro's head of steam has been building thanks to generative AI. Chip companies like Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), AMD (NASDAQ: AMD), and Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) have been tapping the manufacturer to assemble servers (a powerful computer that gets installed in a data center or business office) that power AI applications. It's also getting in on the Arm Holdings data center server game and has a new lineup of servers using chip design start-up Ampere Computing Arm-based chips. Super Micro just upgraded its revenue guidance for 2024, with expectations for it to be in a range between $10 billion and $11 billion -- versus $9.5 billion to $10.5 billion before. The dramatic rise thanks to AI is especially clear when viewing sales over the last five years. Super Micro was hauling in only a few billion dollars in revenue just three years ago. Data by YCharts. However, Super Micro competes against many other companies that design and assemble servers and storage devices on behalf of its semiconductor design and manufacturing partners. Competitors include Cisco Systems, Dell Technologies, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, and a growing presence in the server market from equipment and design manufacturers in Asia like Foxconn and Inspur. All these peers are also sitting on a massive generative AI opportunity. Super Micro is clearly a standout as it has gone from a small and relatively unknown company to a hot stock riding the AI wave. But I can't ignore the hotly competitive field that Super Micro battles in. 2. It's all about forward earnings growth, but not Super Micro's own growth At this point, given the sustained growth Super Micro is expecting, many investors are drawn to the cheap valuation -- especially when comparing it to the premium price chip stocks like Nvidia and AMD are fetching these days. Indeed, Super Micro could be a great long-term value right now. Shares trade for 26 times trailing 12-month earnings per share (EPS), but only 16 times expected EPS for fiscal 2024. That compares to the respective 24 and 27 times expected EPS for Nvidia and AMD for next year. Data by YCharts. However, Super Micro's growth is not coming from its own efforts. Rather, it's riding the coattails of others, primarily leaders in semiconductor design, as it makes hay from the AI movement. No matter how you slice it, Super Micro is dependent on ultimate sales of AI servers powered by partners like Nvidia and AMD, making it a type of derivative bet on those businesses' performance. That's a big reason for the relative discount on Super Micro stock. 3. Super Micro admits it has some key disadvantages Nevertheless, Super Micro is raking in the chips thanks to AI, and its stock is a relative value. So why not just buy? For me, it's all about the business model. Super Micro is not in full control of its own destiny. It could be very cheap if growth continues, but that growth and resulting profitability will be dependent on chip design partners Nvidia, AMD, and the like -- and less on Super Micro's own execution. Again, by Super Micro's own admission in its financial filings, it has limited ability to stave off competitors over the long term. In the last annual filing, Super Micro said the following (italics inserted by me): We seek to protect our intellectual property rights with a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secret laws, and disclosure restrictions. We rely primarily on trade secrets, technical know-how, and other unpatented proprietary information relating to our design and product development activities. In other words, the majority of Super Micro's work has no patent protection, which is a key item I look for when investing in hardware-based businesses (like semiconductor stocks). Although Super Micro certainly has its own proprietary way of designing and assembling enterprise computing and storage systems, few of those processes are granted patent and intellectual property (IP) protection. Again, by Super Micro's own admission in its last annual filing: Our industry is marked by a large number of patents, copyrights, trade secrets and trademarks and by frequent litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violation of intellectual property rights. Our primary competitors have substantially greater numbers of issued patents than we have which may position us less favorably in the event of any claims or litigation with them. Other third parties have in the past sent us correspondence regarding their intellectual property or filed claims that our products infringe or violate third parties' intellectual property rights. In addition, increasingly non-operating companies are purchasing patents and bringing claims against technology companies. We have been subject to several such claims and may be subject to such claims in the future. When looking for a long-term investment in AI, and in whatever other mega trends lie ahead for the greater IT sector, I can't say ""yes"" to owning every stock. This kind of risk and lack of competitive differentiation inherent in Super Micro's business model just doesn't cut it for me. Besides, I already own ample shares of Nvidia, AMD, and data center design leader Arista Networks, so buying Super Micro would offer little in the form of portfolio diversification for me. I understand the draw to Super Micro stock as 2024 gets underway, and the swarm of investors betting on the company could be right in assuming it will be a big beneficiary from the AI movement. But as for me, I'm passing on Super Micro stock again in 2024. Should you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?

"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Like most other tech stocks, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) has been off to a rough start for 2024. After reaching prices nearing $150 per share in late December, AMD stock has since slid back to around $135 per share. The general direction of the broad market has played a role in this. However, valuation-related worries have also been a factor. AMD continues to trade at a moderately high premium to its main peer, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). This comes despite the fact that Nvidia has made far more commercial progress in the area of AI-compatible chips. But while these factors suggest that declines are more likely than further gains in 2024 for AMD shares, it’s not necessarily set in stone that things play out this way. There’s still a path to further gains for the stock. Why? Let’s take a closer look and find out. AMD Stock and the Latest Round of Bearishness As seen from AMD’s latest price performance, the stock is experiencing another round of bearishness. Again, much of this is in tandem with investor sentiment about the broad market. The November and December rally has given way to a January sell-off, as the market re-assess how much the macro picture will improve this year. This negative sentiment shift could carry on in the near-term, having a further impact on the valuation of AMD stock. Alongside this, the other aforementioned factor affecting AMD’s price performance may not be waning in impact, either. Valuation concerns have only just now had an effect, despite commentators from Barron’s and elsewhere expressing them a month ago. Possibly in “priced for perfection” territory, if Advanced Micro Devices falls short of expectations, when it releases its latest results/updates to guidance later this month, investors could use it as justification to make their exit from the stock. Then again, maybe not. Although the skeptics may think that it’s the beginning of the end for AMD’s incredible AI-driven run-up, that’s not necessarily the case. Subsequent developments related to the company’s move into chips for the generative AI market could instead provide more runway. The Ingredients are in Place for Another Banner Year At present, the price-to-forward-earnings ratio for AMD stock is approximately 51. NVDA stock has a forward earnings ratio of only 38.9. On the surface, this suggests that AMD is overvalued, given that it’s Nvidia, not Advanced Micro Devices, that has already capitalized on the AI chips trend. Still, this may be a short-sighted takeaway. AMD’s management has been quite conservative in its AI-related sales forecasts. Back in October, CEO Lisa Su forecasted that the company would sell $2 billion worth of its Instinct MI300 accelerators in 2024. However, AMD could ship 400,000 units of this chip this year. With comparable chips from Nvidia selling for tens of thousands per unit, clearly there’s room for the MI300 to have an outsized impact on AMD’s fiscal results this year. That’s not all. As discussed recently, the company has another promising AI chip product: its Ryzen 8040 Series processors for laptops. Put it all together, and AMD clearly has the ingredients in place for another banner year. The company could “beat and raise” in the quarters ahead, the sell-side could continue raising their earnings forecasts, and the market may carry on factoring in future growth into the stock price. The Verdict If weakness persists with AMD shares in the coming weeks, this may work to your advantage. That’s not to say that you’ll be able to buy this stock at prices last hit in January 2023, but the recent pullback, or any pullback ahead of earnings, may prove to be a solid entry point. Considering Advanced Micro Devices’ latest product launches, plus continued strong demand trends for AI chips, chances are this month’s quarterly earnings release will unveil positive surprises rather than major disappointment. As the months progress, and the company not merely meets, but beats, AI-related expectations, the stock could re-hit its high water mark ($161.91 per share), then keep heading up to new highs. Hence, do not get scared off by the macro doom-and-gloom, or by the valuation skeptics. Make AMD stock a buy instead. AMD stock earns an A rating in Portfolio Grader.

"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips The year 2023 was a great one for the stock market. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 14% to finish the year at a record high. The benchmark S&P 500 index gained 25% and came within a whisker of a record close. And the technology-focused Nasdaq index increased 43% to register its best year since the internet rally of 1999. So, what can we expect in 2024? How will the markets perform in the year ahead? It’s still very early days, but already we are seeing some trends and shifts take hold in the market. The winners and losers of the past year could change in the coming months as investor preferences shift and sentiment takes a different turn. Interest rate cuts, wars in foreign lands, and a potential global recession could each influence markets over the next 12 months. As the New Year begins, we offer 2023 in review: key stock trends and sector shifts unveiled. Bank Stocks Are Hot Again As soon as Fed Chair Jerome Powell announced that three interest rate cuts are likely in 2024, the sun began to shine on bank stocks. Despite their earnings holding up well, bank stocks, as a group, had a miserable 2023. The S&P Banks Index has registered a measly 2% return over the last 12 months, compared to a 25% gain in the benchmark S&P 500 index. And that small gain in the banking index was achieved after Powell announced the potential rate cuts in December. Of course, things really got ugly for all bank stocks after the failures of several regional lenders last spring, including Silicon Valley Bank (OTCMKTS:SIVBQ) and Signature Bank (OTCMKTS:SBNY). However, investors and traders are now putting capital back into bank stocks, with interest rates having now peaked and likely to decline in the coming months. Since the start of the fourth quarter of 2023 last October, the S&P Banks Index has climbed 30% higher and turned positive, with most of that increase occurring in the last month. Influential bank stocks such as JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) are each up 10% since the start of December. BioTech Is Having A Moment Another beneficiary of the expected rate cuts this year appears to be biotech stocks. The equal-weighted SPDR S&P Biotech ETF (NYSEARCA:XBI) has risen 38% since the broader market began to rally at the end of October. The gain is a major reversal for the biotech sector. Before Halloween, the biotech ETF was down 20% on the year. But now, biotech stocks are rallying again as the prospect of lower interest rates comes into view. This makes sense as most biotech stocks, the majority of which are small start-ups, rely on borrowed capital to fund their operations and drug research. In addition to the overall rally among biotech stocks, there has also been a fresh wave of mergers and acquisitions among biotech companies over the last two months. And there are reports that biotech executives are buying up company shares as the stocks rally, providing a further boost of confidence for the sector. On the first trading day of 2024, as the technology-laden Nasdaq index suffered its worst performance since last October, shares of biopharmaceutical company Moderna (NASDAQ:MRNA) rose 13% on news of an analyst upgrade. MRNA stock has now risen 37% since the beginning of December. Microchip and Semiconductor Stocks Are Pulling Back Fueled by the hype surrounding artificial intelligence (AI), stocks of microchip and semiconductor companies led the market higher in 2023. Shares of Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) increased 238% last year, while the stock of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) rose 125%. Now, though, it appears that stocks of chip and semiconductor companies are pulling back. AMD stock has dropped 9% since the last trading day of 2023, while NVDA stock has fallen 5% and appears unable to break above resistance at $500 a share. Other chip and semi stocks are also sliding lower to start 2024. This could be the result of short-term profit-taking or the start of a bigger rotation out of tech and a move away from the AI trade that dominated markets last year. It will take some time to play out, but this type of sector rotation is common in the market. In 2022, stocks of oil and gas companies dominated only to become among the worst performers last year as investors dumped big oil in favor of big tech. On the date of publication, Joel Baglole held a long position in NVDA. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.

"Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) were surging last month after investors responded positively to the launch of its new Instinct MI300 accelerators designed to run advanced artificial intelligence (AI) models. The launch had been long anticipated by investors. AMD stock also benefited from broader market gains during the month, partly in response to the Fed's forecast of lower interest rates in 2024. According to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence, the stock gained 22% in December. As you can see from the chart below, AMD spiked 10% on Dec. 7 after its chip presentation and continued to rise from there. AMD data by YCharts. AMD responds in AI Rival Nvidia has dominated the market thus far for AI chips and components, only increasing the anticipation for the new MI300 and the rest of AMD's new product line. There's a shortage of Nvidia's H100 accelerators and other graphics processing units (GPUs), meaning there's a clear opportunity for AMD to step in. AMD said the new MI300X accelerator offers industry-leading memory bandwidth for generative AI and top performance for large language model training and inference. AMD also projected that the new line of chips would generate $2 billion in revenue in 2024, which would significantly boost its data center business. The company also showed off customers, including Microsoft, Meta Platforms, OpenAI, and Oracle, showing a solid customer base for the new product line. Later in the month, there was little company-specific news on AMD, but the stock seemed to benefit from the broader gains in the morning as the Fed forecast lower rates next year. AMD also seemed to get a boost from better-than-expected results from Micron, the memory-chip maker considered a bellwether for the broader semiconductor market. Micron reported a return to revenue growth, though it still had a wide loss on the bottom line. What's next for AMD in 2024 High expectations are baked into AMD's stock after shares more than doubled in 2023, and the $2 billion revenue forecast from the new MI300 shows that alone will only have a modest impact on the company's financial results. The semiconductor sector has been in a slump in the last year or two, and AMD reported just 4% revenue growth in its most recent quarter, but demand for its CPUs seems to be recovering as well. Given the surge in demand for AI chips and the current shortage, AMD should find a niche to fill and remain a popular choice for tech investors.

"To say that 2023 was a good year for semiconductor stocks is an understatement. The sector, at least as defined by the VanEck Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ: SMH), rocketed 73.4% in 2023! So if you had shied away from this volatile yet important part of the market, you likely missed out on some of the biggest gains of the year. The artificial intelligence (AI) revolution no doubt played a big part, causing some of the largest names like Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices to rise 239% and 128%, respectively. But there are other, really important chip companies with strong business models and important long-term growth trends that lagged the sector. On that note, the following three stocks still look like bargain-priced options in the red-hot sector today. SMH Year to Date Total Returns (Daily) data by YCharts. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing The world's largest chip foundry Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) was up ""only"" 42.3% in 2023, including its 1.9% dividend. But that left the stock only trading around 18 times trailing earnings and under 16 times this year's earnings estimates. That's certainly a more-than-reasonable price to pay for the world's largest foundry that makes basically all of the world's most important chips, from Nvidia's H100 accelerators to AMD's Instinct MI300 to Apple's M-series laptop and A-series mobile processors. 2023 was a down year for many key semiconductor markets, including both PCs and smartphones, which are still the largest chip end markets today. Investors became disappointed in TSMC's results mid-year after second-quarter earnings when management revealed that AI chips made by Nvidia only made up a mid-single-digit percentage of the overall industry. Given how huge Nvidia's growth was last year, that appeared to surprise some investors, who may have been hoping for a bigger AI surge for TSMC. But TSMC stock clawed its way back toward the end of the year when growth surprised to the upside. In its Q2 earnings call with analysts, TSMC management revised down prior guidance for the year, anticipating revenue would fall around 10% for the year. However, things turned out much better than anticipated, as AI demand remained very strong while other key markets started to turn around. TSMC releases its monthly revenue, and through November, its 11-month revenue was only 4.1% below that of 2022 -- much better than the anticipated 10% decline. Eventually, all of those laptops and smartphones bought during the 2020 to 2021 pandemic period will have to be replaced, likely by higher-end chips for AI PCs and other advanced machines. Furthermore, AMD's CEO Lisa Su just increased her outlook for the AI chip market to $400 billion by 2027, up from her June prediction of just $150 billion. While TSMC said it expects AI chips to grow from a mid-single-digit percentage of its revenue to a mid-teens percentage over time, that is probably conservative. With a larger AI market growing very fast as other markets are turning around, look for TSMC to post strong growth in the year ahead. On Semiconductor The electric vehicle (EV) market is projected for long-term growth, especially as technology improves and costs come down. But 2023 saw a slowdown in the market, causing many EV-related stocks to plunge in Q2 and Q3, like silicon carbide leader On Semiconductor (NASDAQ: ON). This year, the supply chain shortages that plagued the industry in 2021 and 2022 were alleviated, leading to ample supply. Meanwhile, higher interest rates dampened demand for EVs, which tend to be a bit pricier than the typical internal combustion engine (ICE). A late summer report showed that EV inventories were piling up at dealerships in the U.S., with some major automakers saying they would slow their battery and EV manufacturing plans. Those fears appeared justified when On reported Q3 earnings, during which it guided for a soft Q4. On is currently a leader in silicon carbide power chips, a difficult-to-manufacture semiconductor alloy that is especially useful in high-power applications, like electric vehicles and infrastructure. The company blamed the slowdown on a very large European customer that had paused some orders, which isn't surprising given the news about slower adoption of certain EV models. But fears that EVs have exhausted early adopters may be misplaced. After all, despite the slowdown, EVs are still growing faster than ICE cars in the U.S., Europe, and China -- just not as fast as some more bullish observers may have anticipated. And as interest rates moderate and charging infrastructure improves, customer adoption should eventually be there. So near-term fears may have opened up an opportunity for longer-term investors in On. After all, the stock only trades at less than 16 times earnings. Moreover, the company is set to improve margins as it brings its new 300mm East Fishkill plant up to speed, so there is also a self-help, margin-improvement story here as well. Image source: Getty Images. Kulicke and Soffa The AI revolution has put a big focus on whichever chipmaker can produce the fastest and most power-efficient chip at the most advanced node. But investors shouldn't ignore chip-packaging companies either, such as industry leader Kulicke and Soffa (NASDAQ: KLIC). These types of companies are somewhat less sexy and use more commoditized machines that connect chips together on a motherboard or even to each other, usually through copper wires or small copper ""bumps."" But as chips become more complex, a greater focus will come on packaging. This is especially true as power and electricity concerns come to the fore, since more powerful chips require more electricity and generate more heat. AI chipmakers are even beginning to construct chips made of ""chiplets,"" which are optimized pieces of silicon stitched together, with new, advanced packaging technologies, into ""superchips."" For instance, AMD's MI300 is made out of 13 different chiplets. Kulicke and Soffa has a dominant market position in ""legacy"" ball bonder packaging equipment, demand for which fluctuates with cycles. But it has smaller revenue segments in newer up-and-coming technologies, such as thermocompression bonding for chiplets, EV battery packaging, and microLEDs -- a new kind of advanced screen that is currently in high-end electronics but could one day eventually spread to smartphones. Not unlike TSMC, Kulicke's mature business in ball bonding is in a downcycle, causing a massive decline in earnings over the past year, from $7.09 in 2022 to just $0.99 in 2023. But if those are the two extremes, one could argue Kulicke's average earnings power is around $4 per share. With the stock at just $51.50 with nearly $13.40 in cash on the balance sheet with no debt, the company's enterprise value (around $38 per share) to average earnings ($4) would be under 10. That's a cheap stock no matter which way you cut it, making Kulicke and Soffa an under-the radar pick in 2024. Should you invest $1,000 in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing right now?

"The trillion-dollar club is certainly rarified air, and one that every company aspires to join. Investors, of course, aspire to find the next candidate with the potential to join such elite company. Odds are, every company that has reached that milestone has made many fortunes for investors along the way. Case in point: Artificial intelligence (AI) chip star Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) began 2023 at just a $350 billion market cap, but has more than tripled since, reaching a market cap today exceeding $1.2 trillion! So, where to find the next big winner? It may not be surprising that I think the AI revolution could mint even more trillion-dollar companies, like this key Nvidia rival. Can Advanced Micro Devices catch up? Given the explosive growth in AI computing we are seeing and are likely to see through this decade, those tailwinds could potentially propel Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) to new heights. That is, of course, only true if the company executes. But AMD's execution has been excellent ever since Lisa Su took over as CEO in October 2014. Back then, AMD had just a $2.4 billion market cap -- yes, you read that right. Fast forward to today, and AMD's market cap has gone up nearly one hundred times under her tenure, to $223 billion. AMD Market Cap data by YCharts How did AMD do it? As is usually the case, a lot of skill, planning, and a little bit of luck. First, Su made the choice to diversify away from PCs, where AMD got 90% of its revenue at the time, and into more high-end applications such as gaming, embedded chips, and data center processors. Second, Su used the 2017 transition to FinFet transistors to attempt to catch up to market leader Intel in process technology. At the time, Intel had a near-monopoly on the processor market and leading technology. AMD practically existed just so many customers would have a secondary option for cheap processors and keep Intel from having 100% of the market. But as chipmaking became more complex, with FinFets and the 7-nanometer process node, Intel stumbled. Meanwhile, AMD's foundry partner Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) excelled and pulled ahead of Intel on leading-edge chipmaking. That left an opportunity for AMD to actually leap ahead of Intel in terms of power and performance, enabling it to gobble up market share from a near-zero starting point. Can AMD pull off the same feat in artificial intelligence chips? Given that AMD was able to meet and overtake a large and dominant rival in PC processors, can the company do it again with AI accelerators? While Nvidia has a big lead in that area today, AMD introduced its challenger MI300 line of AI accelerators in June 2023. The MI300, unlike the all-in-one die that hosts Nvidia's H100, is made up of a ""chiplet"" architecture consisting of 12 chiplets. That architecture allows for some advantages, including a whopping 153 billion transistors, with the ability to handle 192 gigabytes of HBM3 memory. That compares with the H100's ""mere"" 80 billion transistors and just 80GB of HBM memory capacity. In light of these specs, AMD certainly has a shot at getting some looks from AI customers, especially those with memory-hungry applications. No wonder Su has said she expects at least $2 billion in revenue for the MI300 accelerators in 2024, despite just ramping production recently. Can AMD compete with Nvidia in AI? Image source: AMD. But Nvidia should still remain a leader for the foreseeable future While the MI300 exceeds the H100 on certain specs, investors shouldn't expect AMD to match Nvidia any time soon. One important difference is that the MI300 doesn't have the transformer engine of the H100, which can be turned on to triple the H100's performance. That would, of course, shorten the time to train large language models, and could keep customers in the H100 for the most pressing applications. Another advantage for Nvidia is that it will already be coming out with the H200 in the second quarter, and will move on to an entirely new architecture, the B100, next fall/winter. In October 2023, Nvidia announced that it would move from a two-year cadence to a one-year cadence for new AI chip architectures. Given that AMD is just ramping the MI300 now, it will actually be competing more with these newer chips than with the H100. And since Nvidia is now going into turbo-speed, it may be hard for AMD to eventually catch up. This is especially true because Nvidia also uses TSMC as its foundry, so Nvidia will likely not stumble in the way Intel did five years ago. If TSMC stumbles, both Nvidia and AMD would suffer together. In addition, Nvidia has been developing its CUDA software stack since 2006, and has achieved a nice network effect with developers. AMD is quickly developing its own quasi-open-source software stack called RocM, which it's piecing together from its own research and development combined with several recent acquisitions last year. Still, a 15-year-plus head start will be difficult to overcome quickly. But $1 trillion is still in sight by 2030 Even if AMD forever remains a ""next-best"" option for AI chips, it's possible the AI market could be large enough that AMD will reach $1 trillion anyway. After all, at its December 2023 presentation, Su increased her projection for the AI chip market from $150 billion to $400 billion by 2027. While some of that increase comes from chips for ""AI PCs,"" the good news is that AMD will potentially have an even better chance at leading that market, considering its strong position in PCs today. AMD hit $24 billion in revenue in 2022 before the PC downturn caused a slight dip this year. But even an incremental 10% of the $400 billion AI chip market could propel AMD's revenue to, say, $65 billion by 2027. Assuming a 30% net income margin, that could yield $20 billion in earnings. So a price-to-earnings multiple of 50 could get AMD to a $1 trillion market cap by that time. That may seem like a high valuation, but it's a pretty good bet that the AI chip market will continue growing beyond 2027. It's also quite possible AMD could get more than that modest 10% share of the AI chip market. So by 2030, it's certainly a fair shot to get to that $1 trillion market cap, more than four times today's valuation. Should you invest $1,000 in Advanced Micro Devices right now?

"U.S. stock markets closed sharply higher on Monday after finishing the first week of 2024 in red. Technology stocks rebounded following a decline in the yield of U.S. government bond yield. However, the time when the Fed will initiate first interest rate cut remained uncertain. All three major stock indexes ended in positive territory. How Did The Benchmarks Perform? The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) was up 0.6% or 216.9 points to close at 37,683.01. At intraday low, the blue-chip index was down nearly 217 points. Notably, 23 components of the 30-stock index ended in positive territory, while 7 ended in negative zone. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite finished at 14,843.77 or 319.70 points, jumping 2.2% due to strong performance of large-cap technology stocks. Tech behemoths like CrowdStrike Holdings Inc. CRWD and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. AMD, advanced 5.5% and 5.4%, respectively. CrowdStrike Holdings currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. The S&P 500 climbed 1.4% to finish at 4,763.54. Seven out of 10 broad sectors of the broad-market index ended in positive territory while one in negative zone. The Communication Services Select Sector SPDR (XLC), the Technology Select Sector SPDR (XLK) and the Consumer Discretionary Select SPDR (XLY) and the Real Estate Select Sector SPDR (XLRE) advanced 1.6%, 2.5%, 1.7% and 1.4%, respectively. On the other hand, the Energy Select Sector SPDR (XLE) decline 1.6%. The fear-gauge CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) was down 2% to 13.08. Advancers outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by a 3-to-1 ratio. On Nasdaq, a 2.3-to-1 ratio favored advancing issues. The S&P 500 posted 13 new highs and no new lows while the Nasdaq recorded 101 new highs and 92 new lows. U.S. Economy Cooling The Institute of Supply Management (ISM) reported that the manufacturing Index for December came in at 47.4, marginally ahead of the consensus estimate of 47.2. The reading for November was 46.7. Any reading below 50 indicates a contraction in manufacturing activities. December marked the 14th consecutive month of manufacturing contraction after 28th months of expansion. The new orders Index remained in contraction territory at 47.1, lower than November’s reading of 48.3. The ISM also reported that the services Index for December came in at 50.6, reflecting the 12th consecutive months of expansion. Any reading above 50 indicates an expansion in services activities. However, the metric was lower than November’s data of 52.7 and the consensus estimate of 52.5. The sub index for new orders came in at 52.8 in December compared with 55.5 in November. The sub index for employment contracted to 43.3 in December from 50.7 in November. December’s data was the lowest since May 2020. Labor Market Remains Resilient The Department of Labor reported that the U.S. economy added 216,000 jobs in December, beating the consensus estimate of 170,000. However, the metric for November was revised downward to 173,000 from 199,000. The unemployment rate in December was 3.7%, flat month over month but below the consensus estimate of 3.8%. The average hourly wage rate increased 0.4% in December, flat with November but higher than the consensus estimate of 0.3%. Year over year, the wage rate increased 4.1% in December, beating the consensus estimate of 3.9%. Uncertainty on Rate Cut Market participants remained clueless when the Fed will initiate first rate cut. Federal Reserve Governor Michelle Bowman said that she believes rate hike cycle is over. However, she is not yet convinced that the economy is in proper shape to initiate interest rate cut anytime soon. 5 Stocks Set to Double Each was handpicked by a Zacks expert as the #1 favorite stock to gain +100% or more in 2023.

"The iShares Semiconductor ETF (SOXX) was launched on 07/10/2001, and is a smart beta exchange traded fund designed to offer broad exposure to the Technology ETFs category of the market. What Are Smart Beta ETFs? The ETF industry has long been dominated by products based on market cap weighted indexes, a strategy created to reflect the market or a particular market segment. Market cap weighted indexes offer a low-cost, convenient, and transparent way of replicating market returns, and are a good option for investors who believe in market efficiency. However, some investors believe in the possibility of beating the market through exceptional stock selection, and choose a different type of fund that tracks non-cap weighted strategies: smart beta. Based on specific fundamental characteristics, or a combination of such, these indexes attempt to pick stocks that have a better chance of risk-return performance. The smart beta space gives investors many different choices, from equal-weighting, one of the simplest strategies, to more complicated ones like fundamental and volatility/momentum based weighting. However, not all of these methodologies have been able to deliver remarkable returns. Fund Sponsor & Index The fund is managed by Blackrock, and has been able to amass over $9.93 billion, which makes it one of the largest ETFs in the Technology ETFs. SOXX, before fees and expenses, seeks to match the performance of the PHLX SOX Semiconductor Sector Index. The ICE Semiconductor Index measures the performance of U.S. traded securities of companies engaged in the semiconductor business. Cost & Other Expenses Investors should also pay attention to an ETF's expense ratio. Lower cost products will produce better results than those with a higher cost, assuming all other metrics remain the same. Operating expenses on an annual basis are 0.35% for SOXX, making it one of the least expensive products in the space. It's 12-month trailing dividend yield comes in at 0.81%. Sector Exposure and Top Holdings Even though ETFs offer diversified exposure that minimizes single stock risk, investors should also look at the actual holdings inside the fund. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis. Representing 100% of the portfolio, the fund has heaviest allocation to the Information Technology sector. Taking into account individual holdings, Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD) accounts for about 9.48% of the fund's total assets, followed by Broadcom Inc (AVGO) and Intel Corporation Corp (INTC). SOXX's top 10 holdings account for about 59.63% of its total assets under management. Performance and Risk So far this year, SOXX has lost about -2.88%, and was up about 55.09% in the last one year (as of 01/09/2024). During this past 52-week period, the fund has traded between $373.83 and $581.45. The ETF has a beta of 1.37 and standard deviation of 34.63% for the trailing three-year period, making it a high risk choice in the space. With about 35 holdings, it has more concentrated exposure than peers. Alternatives IShares Semiconductor ETF is an excellent option for investors seeking to outperform the Technology ETFs segment of the market. There are other ETFs in the space which investors could consider as well. SPDR S&P Semiconductor ETF (XSD) tracks S&P Semiconductor Select Industry Index and the VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH) tracks MVIS US Listed Semiconductor 25 Index. SPDR S&P Semiconductor ETF has $1.42 billion in assets, VanEck Semiconductor ETF has $11.67 billion. XSD has an expense ratio of 0.35% and SMH charges 0.35%. Investors looking for cheaper and lower-risk options should consider traditional market cap weighted ETFs that aim to match the returns of the Technology ETFs.
