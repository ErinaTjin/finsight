"Chipmakers were among Wall Street's favorites in 2023 as their hardware is crucial to countless industries. And as interest in artificial intelligence (AI) soared, so did demand for graphics processing units (GPUs) -- the powerful chips necessary for training and running AI models. That propelled skyrocketing valuations for chip stocks like Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD), which climbed by 128% over the last 12 months. AMD has ramped up its expansion into AI as it prepares to challenge Nvidia's overwhelming dominance in that market in 2024. Meanwhile, its diverse business gives it solid positions in several other high-growth niches. As a result, there are plenty of reasons to be bullish about AMD's future. However, before you jump into its stock, it would be wise to consider both the positives and potential negatives. So here are two reasons to buy AMD and one reason to sell. One reason to buy: AMD has massive earnings potential in AI AMD's biggest competitor, Nvidia, has seen its business explode in 2023 as it has cornered the market in AI GPUs. The company has an estimated 90% market share in AI chips, and its earnings have skyrocketed. In its fiscal 2024 third quarter, which ended Oct. 29, Nvidia posted revenue growth of 206% year over year while operating income rose 1,600% thanks to surging chip sales. Nvidia's success is promising for its rival, considering that AMD will begin shipping its most powerful GPU ever in 2024. The new chip is designed specifically to compete with Nvidia's offerings. Meanwhile, Microsoft -- a crucial client for AMD -- has already signed on to use the GPU to optimize the AI features in its Azure cloud service. Nvidia's near-total command of the AI chip market will likely be challenging to overcome. However, AMD doesn't need to dethrone the leader to enjoy big gains here. According to a projection from Grand View Research, the AI market will expand at a compound annual rate of 37% through 2030 to a value of more than $1 trillion. With that type of rapid growth, there will be plenty of room for AMD to claim a lucrative slice of the AI pie. Another reason to buy: A diverse business model The tech industry is advancing quickly, with companies increasingly seeking high-powered chips to take their products to the next level. As a result, AMD has formed partnerships with companies across the market, supplying its hardware to cloud platforms, video game consoles, laptops, custom-built PCs, and more. In fact, AMD is the exclusive chip supplier for Sony's PlayStation 5 and Microsoft's Xbox Series X|S, some of the best-selling game consoles of the last few years. The success of these consoles has boosted AMD's gaming revenue by 30% over the last three years as its operating income has climbed 72%. A position in AMD's stock allows investors to profit from the growth of multiple industries. Its shares have risen nearly 730% since 2019, significantly outperforming the Nasdaq Composite and S&P 500. And the company is only just getting started, with AI likely to propel the stock further along its current trajectory. One reason to look elsewhere AMD has a solid long-term outlook. Its chips power an array of devices and systems, and it could see consistent and significant financial growth for decades. However, its stock price soared in 2023 even as it made heavy investments in AI that have yet to start positively impacting its earnings. As a result, its shares are quite expensive by some valuation metrics right now. Data by YCharts. These charts compare the price-to-earnings ratios (P/E) and price-to-free cash flows of some of the biggest names in AI and tech. AMD has by far the highest figures for both valuation metrics, meaning its stock offers the least value. The company looks likely to make serious headway in the AI segment with its soon-to-be-launched AI GPU. However, it's hard to justify its high price point. It might be worth investing in an alternative AI stock for now, and keeping AMD on your radar to reconsider when its valuation comes down to a more attractive level.

"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips 2024 promises to be a lucrative year in the stock market for many reasons. First of all, the Federal Reserve is on track to begin easing off in its efforts to cool an overheated economy. Interest rates are set to decrease with multiple projected cuts on the horizon. Beyond that though, the world continues to evolve at a rapid pace with multiple megatrends promising to galvanize strong growth. Perhaps none is more salient and influential than artificial intelligence. However there are many other trends to consider including sustainability, mobility, demographics, geopolitics and more. The biggest trends, the so-called megatrends, are particularly worth paying attention to. Joby Aviation (ACHR) Source: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com A recent article in Forbes demonstrates why investors should be inherently interested in Joby Aviation (NYSE:ACHR) and its stock. The article paints a picture of an airline passenger who has just disembarked from a Hypersonic flight taking 2 hours from New York to London. That passenger then jumps into an urban air mobility drone, avoiding rush hour traffic, and arrives home in 20 minutes. Urban air mobility has emerged as one of the megatrends to pay attention to in 2023. Firms including Joby Aviation are developing electric vertical takeoff and landing vehicles (eVTOLs) at a rapid pace. These firms have established strong relationships with airline companies, Joby with Delta (NYSE:DAL), that promise to revolutionize commercial flight. The company undertook exhibition flights in New York City in November. The company expects to drastically decrease the time required to and from major airports in the area. For example, it anticipates that a flight to JFK from the surrounding boroughs will decline from 1 hour to 7 minutes. Joby Aviation continues to demonstrate the volume potential of its operations at airports. Joby recently demonstrated that it would be possible to operate 120 flights per hour in and out of busy airports. Lithium Americas (LAC) Source: Wirestock Creators / Shutterstock.com Lithium Americas (NYSE:LAC) Is another stock to consider that leverages the drastic changes occurring across the field of mobility. Electric vehicles continue to displace internal combustion engine vehicles although their growth has not been linear. I am, of course, referring to the recent collapse in lithium prices and EV sales. In short, the electrification of vehicles is not going to stop. EV adoption is still relatively early overall but investors should rest assured the industry is not dying. Lithium did however face a steep price correction in 2023 that saw prices decline by 80%. However with every decline there is always a chance of rebound. Current expectations are that the rebound in lithium prices will begin either in 2024 or perhaps 2025. That coincides quite well with Lithium Americas and its future production plans. The company owns the rights to Thacker Pass which is the largest lithium deposit in the Western hemisphere. Lithium Americas commenced construction in June of this year and anticipates lithium mining operations to start sometime in 2026. It isn’t hyperbolic to suggest that investing in Lithium Americas could produce 10x returns. Nvidia (NVDA) Source: Sergio Photone / Shutterstock.com Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) could pop up on any megatrend stock list for a number of reasons. The company is intimately connected with all things technological being that it is the leading producer of the most in-demand chips. Primarily though, Nvidia promises to provide a strong start to 2024 because of artificial intelligence. Of course, artificial intelligence is a megatrend that has taken off in 2023. Its rapid emergence has turned Nvidia into an even more important company. As strong as Nvidia’s performance has been in 2023, 2024 appears to be just as strong. The analysts covering Nvidia’s shares anticipate that prices could rise by 50% again, if not more. Nvidia has cornered the market for AI chips and demand for its h100 chips has been staggering. That said, the company is expected to launch its updated h200 chips in 2024 that promise to further consolidate its lead over the AI field. AMD (AMD) Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) has to be the other stock to consider in relation to the artificial intelligence megatrend. While the company continues to play second fiddle to Nvidia, it has emerged as a legitimate competitor. Back in mid-November the company announced an event to introduce its MI300 GPU accelerator. Then, weeks later, in early December the company released the new chips which will be available in 2024. The news has sent AMD shares from just below $100 to nearly $150 as I write this. It has become clear that major companies are very interested in AMD’s chips for their application to artificial intelligence. Major purchasers including Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) have noted that they are willing to switch from Nvidia’s h100 chips to AMD’s mi300 chips once they are available. The news is a clear indication that major tech firms believe in AMD and are also frustrated with Nvidia for its pricing. Overall though, it’s a strong indication that AMD is going to remain as a potent challenger in the AI conversation. Qualcomm (QCOM) Source: Akshdeep Kaur Raked / Shutterstock.com Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) is another important tech company that touches on many of the megatrends of the near future. The stock is a wise choice for many reasons including its stability and dividend as well as its relationship with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). For the purposes of this conversation though, I’ll be talking about Qualcomm in relation to its 5G business. 5G is one of the mega trends that has emerged over the past few years. It promises to rapidly increase the speed of communication and the degree of connectivity. The push toward greater and greater connectivity is not going to slow and it is estimated that $20,000 satellites will be launched this decade in order to facilitate that increased connectivity. Qualcomm notes that 5G is imperative for the Continue development of the digital economy. In fact, the company believes that the overall value associated with 5G will exceed $13 trillion by 2035. IBM (IBM) Source: shutterstock.com/LCV IBM (NYSE:IBM) Has emerged as the company that is most closely associated with the development of quantum computing. Quantum computing is a nascent technology that promises to fundamentally change computing overall. The field leverages quantum mechanics to solve problems that are too complex for current classical computers to solve. Quantum computing is an incredibly complex field and those who would like to learn more about it should do so through this link. The important thing to understand for the layman investor like myself is that IBM is the leader in quantum computing. Thus, if any company is best positioned to take advantage of this megatrend, IBM is it. IBM’s industry-best qubit count is expected to more than quadruple by 2025. The company is developing quantum computing hardware as well as software including the cloud-based quantum computing services. If quantum computing lives up to its billing then IBM can grow rapidly. For now, current investors can get a dividend that yields more than 4% making IBM shares attractive for income investors and those looking for future growth. MercadoLibre (MELI) Source: rafapress / Shutterstock.com MercadoLibre (NASDAQ:MELI) often enters discussions that relate to e-commerce and fintech stocks. It’s probably the clearest example of a company that is showing strong results in both regards. The company has emerged as the dominant force in Latin American e-commerce and created a strong, rapidly growing payments platform in the process. MercadoLibre’s results in that regard are incredibly impressive. During the third quarter, revenues increased by more than 69%, reaching $3.8 billion. Meanwhile, gross payment volume grew by 121% to $47.3 billion. And while Mercado Libre deserves recognition for those results, there are other megatrends that I want to focus on. Instead, it is the megatrend of emerging markets. Economists continue to note that emerging markets have vast untapped potential. World superpowers including the United States and China face significant problems which has led investors to look at emerging markets with a greater focus. Thus, firms like MercadoLibre are well positioned due to their exposure to the emerging market trend as well as those in fintech and commerce.

"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Driven by large opportunities in artificial intelligence in particular and a general recovery of the chip market, AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) stock could very well outperform the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq in 2024. But on the other hand, the firm’s valuation appears to bake in continued, large market share gains by AMD at Intel’s (NASDAQ:INTC) expense, and that scenario may very well not materialize. Given these points, I rate AMD stock as a “hold” at this point, and I view INTC as a much better alternative. This article will walk the reader through my thesis and comparison of AMD stock and its peers. AMD Has Huge Opportunities On Dec. 22, Swiss bank UBS issued a bullish note on the chip market in general and AMD stock in particular. According to the bank, chip makers are heading into a “sweet spot… (as) inventory has peaked and started converting to revenue,” Moreover, the firm thinks that AMD is well-positioned to benefit from data centers’ expansion while the entire sector will get a lift from the incorporation of AI chips into smartphones and PCs. UBS named AMD and Micron (NASDAQ:MU) as its two top picks in the chip space. Meanwhile, on Dec. 6, AMD launched its “next-gen AMD Instinct MI300 data center GPU accelerator family,” another InvestorPlace columnist, Chris MacDonald, noted. CEO Lisa Su has asserted that these chips are “comparable to Nvidia’s H100 chips in training (large language models)” but are superior to NVDA’s H100 chips on inference by 40% “when working with Meta’s Llama 2, a 70 billion parameter LLM,” The Verge reported. Assuming that Su’s assertions are at least close to accurate, the Instinct MI300 chips can accelerate AMD’s top and bottom line growth by large amounts, given the huge demand for high-quality AI chips and Nvidia’s inability to meet that demand. The Risks of Buying AMD Stock Trading at a forward price/earnings ratio of 40 and an Enterprise Value/EBITDA ratio of 58, AMD stock is pricey. Tech enthusiast Jackson Luca asserts that “most bullish forecasts for AMD assume continued share grabs against Intel across PCs and the cloud data center. ” Given Luca’s statement and the high valuation for AMD stock, I believe the shares will probably bake in continued major share gains by AMD at Intel’s expense. But with Intel appearing to have greatly improved the quality of its offerings, those gains may not come to pass. Specifically, the firm has started incorporating ‘neural processing units’ into its computer processing unit chips, enabling its CPUs to handle “AI workloads without needing an external GPU,” Luca noted. And, although the benchmark score of Intel’s upcoming Gaudi 3 AI chips is meaningfully lower than that of AMD’s MI300, Gaudi 3 does beat AMD’s offering regarding transistor count. Also importantly, the Gaudi 3 offers double the memory capacity of the MI300, even though the chips are the same size. Moreover, as I reported in a previous column, Intel cannot make the Gaudi 2 (Gaudi 3’s predecessor) quickly enough to meet demand. Of course, that indicates that firms are enthusiastic about Gaudi 2 and will like Gaudi 3 even more. Also noteworthy is that Luca’s “base case” scenario involves AMD losing “marginal..(market) share” to Intel, causing AMD stock to stay “rangebound” for some time going forward. I believe that’s a very realistic prediction. Intel Is a Better Choice I view Intel as a better choice than AMD for investors. With a forward price-earnings ratio of 28, Intel has a huge opportunity in AI and, over the longer term, looks poised to generate a great deal of revenue by manufacturing chips for other companies.

"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips As it stands now, six U.S.-listed stocks are in the “trillion dollar club,” or stocks with a market cap of at least $1 trillion. In the coming year, or in the years ahead, which other mega-cap stocks (stocks with a market cap of $200 billion or more) will join them and become the next trillion-dollar companies? That’s a question on the minds of many investors. Technological breakthroughs in areas like artificial intelligence and electric vehicles point to several companies “joining the club.” So, too, do breakthroughs/long-term trends in other areas, like healthcare and financial services. There are also mega-cap companies that, while growing at only a moderate pace, are within reach of hitting the trillion-dollar mark within this decade. With this in mind, let’s take a look at seven companies that appear most likely to become trillion-dollar stocks and when exactly each of them can reach this milestone. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Source: Fabio Alcini / Shutterstock.com When it comes to the next chip stock to join Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) in the trillion dollar club, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is a name that to many may first come to mind. Yet, while the chip designer is currently making its own big moves in AI chips, reaching a $1 trillion market cap may be easier said than done. AMD stock currently has a market cap of around $236 billion. Hence, shares need to surge more than fourfold to join the trillion-dollar club. With AMD rising eightfold over the past five years, quadrupling in price should be a cinch, right? Not necessarily. Due to this year’s ‘AI mania,’ AMD’s AI catalyst appears to be priced in and then some. Unless the company’s AI endeavors result in earnings many times that of current estimates, even reaching trillion-dollar status by 2030 may be, at best, a stretch. Broadcom (AVGO) Source: Sasima / Shutterstock.com AMD may not be on the fast track to becoming one of the next trillion-dollar companies, but another semiconductor firm might be. It is Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO). Why? AVGO is already more than halfway there, with a market cap of $527.2 billion. Furthermore, as argued previously, AVGO stock may have a far greater runway than other top AI stocks. Valuation is a big reason for this. AVGO trades at a forward multiple in the low 20s. “Magnificent Seven” AI stocks trade for 30-40 times forward earnings. Also, Broadcom could eke out billions in cost/growth synergies from its recent VMware merger, enabling the company to beat current earnings growth expectations. To reach a $1 trillion market cap, all AVGO needs to do is rise in value by just under 90%. A mix of multiple expansion and earnings growth could get it there sooner than you think. Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-A, BRK-B) Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A, NYSE:BRK-B), legendary investor Warren Buffett’s investment vehicle, is even closer than AVGO to reaching the trillion-dollar threshold. The Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate currently has a market cap of $777.9 billion. This means all BRK.A/BRK.B stock needs to do is rise by 28.5% to achieve this valuation goal. Given the mostly “old economy” nature of Berkshire and its various businesses/holdings, not to mention its huge size, you may think that reaching a trillion is, at best, several years away for the company. However, as a Seeking Alpha commentator recently argued, the “road to $1 trillion” may not be as long as it seems. Per the commentator, even if growth among Berkshire’s businesses screeched to a halt, adding these stagnant cash flows to the company’s war chest would still justify a move to a $1 trillion valuation. Eli Lilly (LLY) Source: shutterstock.com/Michael Vi Admittedly, Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) may be the most questionable candidate to become one of the next trillion-dollar companies. Shares in the big pharma firm have surged to a valuation of $522.4 billion thanks to the massive potential of its drug candidate, Zepbound. While initially developed as a treatment for diabetes under the Mounjaro name, Eli Lilly has been working to get Zepbound approved as an obesity treatment. Given Novo Nordisk’s (NYSE:NVO) success with its Ozempic/Wegovy obesity treatment, it’s no surprise that Wall Street is very bullish on LLY stock. Yet while further positive news regarding Mounjaro/Zepbound may lead to further gains for LLY, with shares trading for 88.4 times earnings, one can argue that the future growth potential of this and other obesity treatments is already priced into the stock. Hence, you may want to tread carefully with this trillion-dollar contender. Meta Platforms (META) Source: Cat Box / Shutterstock.com With a market cap of $919.7 billion, it may be a matter of months, not years, before Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) becomes one of the next trillion-dollar stocks. In fact, as I argued recently, shares in the Facebook and Instagram parent could climb to a value well above $1 trillion during 2024. Put simply, a combination of earnings growth, further progress with the company’s AI efforts, plus greater appreciation of Meta’s AI bona fides could result in META stock (at around $360 per share today) rallying to $500 or $600 per share. In other words, it’s within the realm of possibility that Meta Platforms will become a $1.5 trillion (by market cap) company within a year. That’s a valuation that would put Meta’s valuation in the same ballpark as other trillion-dollar club members like Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). Tesla (TSLA) Source: Arina P Habich / Shutterstock.com It may be strange to say that Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is one of the next trillion-dollar companies. Mainly because the EV industry leader was, at one point, a trillion-dollar company. In October 2021, just before the 2021-2022 stock market downturn, TSLA attained a market cap exceeding $1 trillion. The stock experienced a massive drawdown from late 2021 through January 2023. Following this, a massive rebound throughout 2023. As a result, TSLA stock is back to a market cap of around $804.8 billion. All that’s necessary to send Tesla back to trillion-dollar status is a 24.25% move higher. Even as Tesla skeptics point to issues like the EV sales slowdown as signs that TSLA will slide lower in 2024, as I pointed out last week, a potential catalyst could supercharge shares later in the year: the debut of a low-priced, mass-market Tesla EV model. Visa (V) Source: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.com Visa (NYSE:V) is another mega-cap that’s halfway towards the trillion-dollar market cap mark. Shares in payment technology companies have produced outsized long-term returns for investors since the stock’s debut in the late 2000s. Following an incredible run from a split-adjusted $15-$20 per share in early 2008 to around $260 per share today, some may expect V stock to produce more modest returns from here. However, the move from cash-based to card/digital-based transactions continues. This company also continues to benefit from having a deep economic moat. It is not far-fetched to think that Visa could continue reporting double-digit annual earnings growth in the years to come. In short, Visa is one of the “it’s a matter of when, not if” trillion-dollar contenders. With this, plus the stock’s reasonable valuation (26.3 times earnings) compared to growth forecasts, consider making it a long-term buy.

"Semiconductors are the foundation upon which artificial intelligence (AI) thrives, but knowing that is only part of the battle. For investors using ETF to access chip stocks, some homework could pay dividends regarding identifying the chip ETFs with the most AI relevancy. The VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH) is among the ideas that come to mind. The $11.7 billion SMH turned turned 12 years old in December. It was higher by nearly 73% as of December 26. That's a stellar performance to be sure. And it's one that’s been fueled in part by the fund’s robust AI adjacency. As a semiconductor play on AI, SMH’s construction is highly pertinent to interested investors. Three of the most widely held stocks by AI and big data funds, including ETFs, are Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Nvidia (NVDA) and Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM). That trio represents three of SMH’s top four holdings. Moats Matter Nvidia and Taiwan Semiconductor combine for 28.46% of the SMH roster. That’s relevant on multiple levels, not the least of which is Nvidia is viewed as one of the most AI-relevant stocks, particularly in the chip space. Still, SMH’s more than 9% weight to Taiwan Semiconductor shouldn’t be glossed over. After all, that company is the largest chip foundry operator in the world. That means that as demand for AI chips increases, so will demand for Taiwan Semiconductor’s services. That speaks to Taiwan Semiconductor’s status as a wide moat company -- a trait shared with Nvidia. “Companies with economic moats could be more likely to benefit and may be less susceptible to disruption from AI than those without moats. Moats based on a combination of customer switching costs, unique datasets, and brands could be particularly valuable,” noted Morningstar. “Companies with durable advantages could use AI to improve their products and services and strengthen their competitive positions.” Competitive Advantages Have Myriad Appeal The durable competitive advantages possessed by Nvidia and Taiwan Semiconductor are appealing for other reasons. As Morningstar points out, companies with that trait are usually profitable. They usually generate significant amounts of free cash flow. That could be advantageous in turbulent economic climates. Overall, SMH remains a valid AI consideration. That's particularly so for market participants that want to eschew stock-picking in a still-evolving niche. “Artificial intelligence is an exciting theme, and we expect a lot of market interest in 2024. One effective way to access the AI theme without paying huge valuation premiums is via second-derivative plays. These are not the chipmakers or those that offer technology interfaces. Rather, it's those who can effectively embed AI into their workflow and drive new revenue growth opportunities. The principles of good investing still apply,” concluded Morningstar.

"Following the launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT, generative artificial intelligence (AI) has taken the market by storm, helping send the S&P 500 Index up 25% year to date. Industry leaders such as Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) have been key in helping power the rally because of their fast-growing chip businesses. Let's discuss why 2024 could be even more exciting for these two AI-related stocks. 1. Nvidia With shares up a jaw-dropping 246% in 2023, Nvidia is arguably the biggest winner in 2023's AI gold rush. And unlike some other AI companies, its operating performance has surged to match the hype. It isn't too late for investors to bet on Nvidia's continued success because of its reasonable valuation and spectacular margins. Nvidia's business is shifting from lower-value gaming hardware to high-performance AI chips. And that shift is transforming its operations. Third-quarter revenue increased by 206% year over year to a record of $18.12 billion, while net income surged by 1,259% to $9.2 billion. This is partially because of a dramatic rise in margin as the company sells more expensive data center chips like the H100, which can cost as much as $30,000 per unit. Nvidia is also tackling other growth opportunities like China, where U.S. trade restrictions limit the import of some of its most advanced hardware. To comply with the rules, the company has launched slower versions of its Nvidia RTX4090 gaming chip, specifically for Chinese consumers. This move follows a November announcement of plans to develop AI chips customized for the Chinese market. With a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) growth rate of just 25, Nvidia stock is relatively cheap compared with its projected growth over the next 12 months. To put that number in context, the S&P 500 trades for an average of 26. 2. Advanced Micro Devices With Nvidia making boatloads of money from its data center chip business, its biggest rival, AMD, is vying for a piece of the opportunity through advanced AI hardware of its own. And while the chipmaker has yet to report significant gains from these efforts, investors can look forward to seeing the business scale up rapidly in 2024 and beyond. According to AMD's CEO Lisa Su, the market for AI-capable chips will surge tenfold to $400 billion by 2027. To take advantage of the opportunity, the company released the MI300 family of AI chips, which can outperform Nvidia's flagship H100 on key metrics like memory space and inference (running AI platforms). Image source: Getty Images. So far, AMD's new products have had no significant impact on the company's performance. Third-quarter revenue increased only 4% to $5.8 billion. However, analysts are optimistic that its new chips will see large-scale deployment in 2024, leading to significant revenue growth. AMD's valuation is nowhere near as good as Nvidia's, considering its significantly lower growth rate in the near term. In fact, with a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 39, its shares are more expensive than its larger rival. However, the situation could change as AMD's AI efforts start supercharging its operating performance. There's room for two (or more) While Nvidia and AMD are about to enter direct competition in the market for the most advanced AI hardware, that doesn't mean one company has to lose for the other to win. As mentioned, AMD's management believes the market for AI chips will surge more than tenfold to $400 billion. That figure is more than 20 times Nvidia's trailing 12-month revenue, leaving plenty of room for both companies to sell these products as fast as they can produce them, even if the market reaches only a fraction of those lofty estimates. Both stocks can continue their bull runs in 2024 and beyond. Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?

"The artificial intelligence (AI) market exploded in 2023 and shows no signs of slowing. The debut of ChatGPT reignited interest in the sector and forced many to rethink what they thought was currently possible with the technology. As a result, countless companies pivoted their businesses to developing the industry. Data from Grand View Research shows the AI market is projected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of 37% through 2030. That would see it hit annual sales exceeding $1 trillion before the decade's end. That makes now a great time to invest in this rapidly expanding industry and potentially profit from its promising outlook. Here are three AI stocks you might want to consider buying hand over fist in January. 1. Advanced Micro Devices Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) has an exciting year ahead, with plans to strengthen its role in AI by launching a new chip. The company will begin shipping its MI300X graphics processing unit (GPU) in 2024, designed specifically to challenge Nvidia's dominance. Nvidia soared to the top of the market in 2023, getting a headstart as it snapped up an estimated 90% market share in AI chips. Its success in the industry highlighted how far chipmakers like AMD are behind when it comes to AI. However, AMD spent the last 12 months refining its AI technology and it's hoping to make a big splash in the sector this year. As the cost of AI chips rises, the industry is desperate for increased competition and alternatives to Nvidia. Consequently, AMD's MI300X has support from firms across tech, with Microsoft's Azure announcing in December that it will become the first cloud platform to use the new GPU to optimize its AI offerings. Data by YCharts The chart above shows AMD's earnings could hit $5 per share by fiscal 2025. When that figure is multiplied by the company's forward price-to-earnings ratio of 55, it gives a stock price of $275, suggesting growth of 87% over the next two fiscal years. AMD is on a promising growth trajectory and could be one of the smartest investments this month. 2. Intel Like AMD, Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) is hard at work designing a new AI chip to take on Nvidia in 2024. In December the company unveiled several new additions to its product lineup, including the Gaudi3, which is launching this year and is capable of powering demanding AI models. Intel has transformed itself over the last few years. A long history of dominance in central processing units (CPUs) saw it grow complacent, leaving it vulnerable to competition. Its CPU market share fell from 82% to 61% between 2017 and 2023 as AMD strengthened its position in the industry. Then in 2020, Apple ended its partnership with Intel in favor of in-house hardware, taking a significant bite out of the chipmaker's earnings. However, instead of throwing in the towel, the hurdles seemed to light a fire under Intel again. The company unveiled its first consumer GPUs in October 2022, venturing into a new market that would see it go head-to-head with Nvidia and AMD. The move was a smart one in the run-up to the boom in AI, as GPU technology is crucial to its success in the industry over the long term. Data by YCharts Intel's massive growth potential is evident in its EPS estimates. This chart shows its earnings are projected to reach nearly $3 per share over the next two fiscal years. In a similar calculation to AMD, multiplying the figure by Intel's forward P/E of 53 yields a stock price of $140. If the estimates hold, the company's shares would deliver growth of 180% by fiscal 2025. As a result, Intel is absolutely an AI stock worth buying hand over fist this January. 3. Alphabet Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) enjoyed a glowing 2023. Its digital ad business made an impressive turnaround from the previous year, with revenue rising 11% year over year in its latest quarter (the third quarter of 2023) as it beat analysts' expectations by $980 million. Meanwhile, the tech giant has exciting prospects in AI. Alphabet's highly anticipated large language model Gemini debuted in early December, and is capable of crunching various forms of data with more sophisticated reasoning than any of the company's previous technology. Gemini and Alphabet's potent platforms, like Google Search and Android, could prove a powerful combination, presenting countless ways for the company to expand in AI. Alongside free cash flow that rose 29% over the last year to $77 billion, Alphabet has the financial resources and brand loyalty to go far in the industry. Data by YCharts Alphabet's biggest competitors in AI are cloud giants Amazon and Microsoft. However, Gemini and Alphabet's massive user base suggests the company has equal, if not more, earnings potential in AI. Meanwhile, this chart shows Alphabet's P/E and price-to-free cash flow are significantly lower than those of its rivals, making its stock a bargain compared to Amazon and Microsoft. Alphabet likely has a bright future in AI and is a no-brainer investment this month. Should you invest $1,000 in Advanced Micro Devices right now?

"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Advanced Micro Devices’ (NASDAQ:AMD) journey in the microprocessor space was volatile in 2023. Fortunately for investors, AMD stock mostly moved up and to the right, finishing the year with an impressive gain of more than 125%. The company’s Ryzen 8040 Series laptop processors promise a 60% performance boost for AI applications, leading AMD back into the spotlight. AMD’s Instinct MI300 Series accelerators also position the company well to compete in the AI chip field long term. Additionally, AMD’s MI300 chips position the company as a formidable competitor to Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) in the data center and AI segments. CEO Lisa Su anticipates a $2 billion contribution from these markets in 2024, though some analysts view this projection as conservative. Amid strong competition in 2024, AMD’s innovative AI chip presence is certainly worth considering for investors looking at relative value in this sector. Here are a few catalysts investors may want to watch right now regarding AMD stock. New Graphics Card Lineup In addition to the company’s product lineup, AMD is set to release its Radeon RX 7600 XT. This chip is intended to bridge the performance and pricing gap between the RX 7600 and RX 7700XT. Launching sometime during the week of January 22nd as a rival Nvidia’s RTX 4060 and RTX 4060 Ti chips should gain traction given this chip’s improved VRAM. AMD will exclusively rely on custom models from partners like Sapphire, XFX, ASUS and Gigabyte for the Radeon RX 7600 XT, bypassing an MBA (Made By AMD) GPU release. While exact specifications remain undisclosed, speculation suggests the GPU might boast 10GB or 12GB of GDDR6 memory, potentially outpacing Nvidia’s RTX 40 series GPUs in VRAM. Assuming no plans for a Radeon RX 7700 non-XT, speculation is that the RX 7600 XT, likely featuring around 40 Compute Units, will serve as an RDNA 3 replacement for the RX 6700 XT. Utilizing Navi 32 silicon with 10GB or 12GB of VRAM, AMD maximizes its Navi 33 silicon, leaving no untapped resources for the Radeon RX 7600. The expectation is that any higher-end GPU below the RX 7700 XT will utilize Navi 32 silicon with disabled CUs, eliminating the need for new RDNA 3 GPU silicon. Confidence Boost from Microsoft and Meta At an AMD investor event, Meta (NASDAQ:META), OpenAI and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) announced adoption of AMD’s latest AI chip, the Instinct MI300X. This signals a shift toward alternatives to Nvidia graphics processors in AI, potentially impacting Nvidia’s market dominance. AMD CEO Lisa Su highlighted the industry’s focus on powerful GPUs for the cloud, discussing the MI300X’s new architecture and key feature—192GB of high-performance HBM3 memory. The comparison with Nvidia’s H100 emphasizes improved user experiences. Still, the challenge for AMD lies in convincing companies accustomed to Nvidia to invest time and resources in adopting an additional GPU supplier. Su acknowledged the effort required for this transition. AMD upgraded ROCm to rival Nvidia’s CUDA, addressing a key preference among AI developers. Pricing for the MI300X wasn’t disclosed, but Lisa Su emphasized the necessity for cost-effectiveness compared to Nvidia’s chips, which can reach around $40,000. Buy AMD Now AMD has swiftly secured major clients for its MI300X chip. Strategic pricing, estimated by Ark Invest at $18,000 to $19,000 to maximize market share, could entice customers away from Nvidia’s pricier alternatives. AMD’s MI300X boasts substantial performance gains over NVDA’s H100, promising cost efficiency for adopters. Despite Nvidia’s H200 chip being faster, AMD’s integrated software makes this company a formidable competitor in the AI chip race. Additionally, given the company’s relative value compared to Nvidia, I could certainly see much better performance with AMD stock in 2024, all things being equal.

"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips The start of a new year is the perfect time for a stock market recap. As 2023 came to a close the U.S. stock market has finally ended on a high note. In the beginning of the year, many market analysts and stock-pickers were worried about the way in which the macroeconomic environment would impact not only the general business environment but also the performance of stocks as a whole. Fortunately, since then, inflation has fallen down precipitously and the global economy appears to be avoiding a calamitous recession, both clear wins for the U.S. Federal Reserve. Currently, the Nasdaq has risen 43.6% from a year-to-date perspective, and the S&P500 has appreciated 24.2%. Below is a stock market recap on certain stocks and sectors that drove the market this year. AI Chip Stocks: AMD (AMD) and Nvidia (NVDA) Source: graphicINmotion/Shutterstock Of course, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) has been one of the best-performing stocks of 2023, with its staggering gain of more than 239.0% year to date. The chipmaker’s shares catapulted earlier in the year after OpenAI released its now famous ChatGPT conversational AI. Since then, Nvidia has been riding high on the booming demand for its artificial intelligence solutions, which continue to power some of the most advanced applications in the world. Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is already getting ready to release its MI300x GPU chipset, which was announced in the second quarter of 2023. The company expects to sell $2 billion in AI chips in 2024, potentially breaking up Nvidia’s monopolistic stranglehold on the AI chip market. AMD shares have more than doubled in value since the start of the year. All in all, next year could exciting year for both stocks. IonQ (IONQ) Source: Amin Van / Shutterstock.com IonQ (NYSE:IONQ) is the first pure-play quantum computing firm, and the company uses trapped ion technology to build its quantum computers. While the quantum computing firm is still technically pre-revenue, the company has worked hard to market its quantum computing services. For example, IonQ has been able to partner with Amazon Web Services and other cloud providers to offer its quantum computing services on public cloud networks. Similarly, IonQ released two quantum computing solutions in October, IonQ Forte Enterprise and IonQ Tempo. These solutions are tailored for both businesses and governments to integrate quantum capabilities within their existing infrastructure. The hype around artificial intelligence has certainly spilled over into companies operating in the quantum computing space, as there is a lot of intersection in terms of applications. As a result, IonQ shares have risen 259% YTD, clearly ending the year as a top performer. US-listed Brazilian Companies Source: Shutterstock Perhaps unbeknownst to many, there are a number of US-listed companies with headquarters in Brazil that have had a terrific year. When doing a stock market recap for 2023, the first that immediately comes to mind is Petrobras (NYSE:PBR), the state-run oil and gas behemoth. The stock has risen 87.5% year-to-date due to elevated energy prices and less than expected market interference from current President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva’s government. As war rages on in the Middle East and OPEC production cuts remain in place, oil prices could remain elevated in the near term, and Brazilian oil companies could continue to pick up the tab on providing oil to the rest of the world. The Warren Buffet-backed Nubank (NYSE:NU) has also had an outstanding 2023, not only in terms of share price appreciation but also strong YOY revenue and customer growth. In particular, revenue growth in Q3 2023 came in at around 53% YOY. Despite higher interest rates, which could have negatively affected the demand for credit cards and personal loans, Nubank’s credit card and personal loan portfolios have instead expanded to $15.1 billion, up 48% YOY, while deposits totaled to $19.1 billion. Shares in Embraer (NYSE:ERJ), the commercial and defense aircraft designer and manufacturer, have risen 68.2%. The release of its new passenger jet, the E195-E2, and the subsequent $1.2 billion sell of which to Porter Airlines has helped the aircraft company build backlog and gain traction in the space.

"AMD (NASDAQ: AMD) stock lost ground Tuesday -- the first trading day of 2024. The semiconductor specialist's share price ended the day down 6%, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. AMD stock fell on news that ASML had halted shipments of its lithography machines for semiconductor fabrication to China. ASML's decision reportedly stemmed from pressure applied by the U.S. government. In addition to the big semiconductor-industry news, tech stocks also fell after Barclays analyst Tim Long downgraded the investment company's rating on Apple stock from ""neutral"" to ""underweight."" Long lowered his one-year price target on Apple from $161 per share to $160 per share citing a less favorable outlook for the iPhone line and potential weakening for the company's services business. Is AMD stock a buy after today's sell-off? Today's big pullback for AMD stock highlights some of the key valuation threats facing the tech sector -- and growth-dependent chip stocks in particular. In terms of AMD's business-performance outlook, the ASML news looks much more significant than the ratings downgrade for Apple stock from Barclays. Tensions continue to rise between the U.S. and China, and the semiconductor industry has become a central battleground in the competition between the two world powers. While the U.S. has made moves to limit China's ability to purchase and manufacture high-performance artificial intelligence (AI) chips, China has indicated that it plans to bring Taiwan back under its territorial control. Given that AMD relies on chip-fabrication services from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, the fraught geopolitical situation remains a key risk factor for the company. Following surging interest in AI technologies and momentum for the broader semiconductor space, AMD stock has also been pushed up to a much more growth-dependent valuation. AMD PE Ratio (Forward 1y) data by YCharts. While AMD's stock has posted explosive gains over the last year, the business's recent performance has been less impressive. Revenue rose 8% year over year in the third quarter, while non-GAAP (adjusted) earnings per share were up 21%. The semiconductor specialist's business performance hasn't been bad, but it's important to keep in mind that the 114% increase for its share price over the last year has been aided significantly by excitement about future opportunities in AI. Ultimately, I do think that AMD has what it takes to be a worthwhile long-term investment. The company looks poised to continue gaining market share from Intel in the central processing unit (CPU) and server markets, and it may also be able to gain some ground against Nvidia in the graphics processing unit (GPU) space that is central to the AI race. AMD has the potential to be a big winner, but investors should keep in mind that the stock's outlook is much more speculative after a year of explosive gains.

"Wall Street is ending 2023 on a high note. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite gained about 43% in 2023. It may rise even higher in the coming months, driven mainly by positive economic indicators such as higher-than-expected corporate earnings and third-quarter gross domestic product (GDP) growth that surpassed most forecasts. A potential economic recovery makes it easier for technology companies to access capital for disruptive innovations. Not surprisingly, being composed of many innovative-technology stocks, the Nasdaq Composite will benefit significantly in the case of an uptick in economic activity in 2024. Artificial intelligence (AI) has been the hottest investment theme in 2023, and is poised to remain a major trend in 2024. Improvement in the economic landscape may drive up share prices of many AI stocks in the coming months. Hence, it makes sense to pick up small stakes in some fundamentally strong AI stocks with well-proven monetization models. Here's why Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) and Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI) fit the bill. Advanced Micro Devices The first name on my AI stock list is leading chip designer Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) -- a stock that has gained almost 130% in 2023. This semiconductor giant needs no introduction, especially since the company has been frequently in the news for its advances in the field of graphic processing units (GPUs) and central processing units (CPUs). AMD expects demand for AI infrastructure in cloud, enterprise, embedded, and personal computing use cases to grow rapidly in future years. The company has also estimated the target addressable market of the data-center accelerator market to grow annually at more than 70% and reach $400 billion by 2027. AMD's recently launched Instinct™ MI300 family of accelerators, optimized for power-intensive AI and high-performance computing (HPC) workloads in data centers, seem well positioned to capitalize on this growing opportunity. Chief Executive Officer Lisa Su claimed that while MI300 chips are comparable to Nvidia's H100 chips in training large language models (LLMs), they are 1.4 times better in performance for inferencing (real-time running) models. Further, the company is also striving to ensure a sufficient supply of MI300 chips to meet the rising demand from cloud and enterprise segments. AMD expects MI300 revenue to surpass the $2 billion target in 2024. Besides MI300 chips, AMD is also focusing on offering a broad range of other energy-efficient GPUs, CPUs, and adaptive computing solutions for training and inferencing LLMs. The company is also working to develop networking solutions that can orchestrate across multiple GPUs for AI applications. AMD has further developed a robust, open, proven, and developer-friendly software ecosystem for GPU computations called the ROCm (Radeon Open Compute) software stack. This includes frameworks, libraries, compilers, drivers, developing tools, and APIs (application programming interfaces) that support multiple programming models. ROCm is further supporting the adoption of AMD's chips in the AI and high-performance computing (HPC) markets. Besides strength in its AI business, AMD's core server CPU business and personal computing business are also showing signs of improvement. In the third quarter, the company's fourth-generation Epyc server processor revenue was up sequentially by more than 50%. The company also witnessed rising demand for its Genoa and Bergamo chips from hyperscale customers. Furthermore, the company reported a solid 50% sequential growth in its client segment in the third quarter. Considering the future growth potential in the AI business and the strength of its core offerings, AMD can be a great stock to buy ahead of more Nasdaq gains. Super Micro Computer The second stock on my list is Super Micro Computer, a leading provider of high-end server and storage systems, which has emerged as a major beneficiary of the explosive growth in the AI market. The company reported a surge in demand for its LLM-optimized AI platforms, especially for Nvidia's HGX-H100 server building block integrated into its servers, in the first quarter of fiscal 2024 (ended Sept. 30). SMCI is also gearing up to monetize its new AI-optimized server offerings based on Nvidia's GH200 Grace Hopper Superchip, AMD's MI250 and MI300 family of chips, and Intel's Gaudi 2 CPU. Being the first to market advanced servers with the latest silicon chips gives the company a solid edge against the competition. Super Micro has been quite successful in differentiating its products from other mass-produced servers, mainly due to its ""building block"" or modular approach of assembling proprietary chips and networking technologies into servers. Unlike traditional servers, which require a significant overhaul to suit different applications and technology upgrades, SMCI's highly configurable servers enable customers to easily scale or replace components, at minimal cost. The company's liquid cooling technology also allows better energy utilization and thermal management of its datacenter server and storage solutions. Considering the high-power consumption and thermal challenges posed by AI-optimized servers, SMCI's energy efficiency solutions are helping bring down data-center costs. The company is now expecting 20% of the total data-center deployments to opt for its liquid cooling technology. Besides the AI training market, Super Micro is also benefiting from rising demand for servers in telecommunication-optimized edge computing products and AI inferencing platforms. Despite the many pros, Super Micro currently trades at only 2.2 times trailing-12-month sales -- quite reasonable considering that analysts on average expect the company's revenue to grow 51% year over year to $10.76 billion in fiscal 2024 (ending June 30, 2024). Hence, Super Micro seems to be a compelling pick now. Should you invest $1,000 in Advanced Micro Devices right now?

"If artificial intelligence (AI) was the story of 2023, then Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) was the stock of the year. No other company's products were as in demand from the generative AI boom, and no other company has the financial performance to prove it. Nvidia stock finished 2023 up 239% last year, crossing the trillion-dollar mark to become only one of five U.S. stocks to have a valuation above that line. The business also delivered phenomenal growth on the top and bottom lines. In its third quarter, revenue jumped 206% to $18.12 billion, and its net income according to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) jumped more than thirteenfold to reach $9.24 billion, giving it a margin of more than 50%. Heading into 2024, Nvidia looks to be in great shape for even more growth. Its AI-focused H100 accelerators are in such high demand that prices for them have skyrocketed, and there's a shortage of its GPUs and other components used for its AI models. The spoils of the AI boom are likely to spill over to other companies in 2024, and while Nvidia may retain its lead in AI chips, other chip stocks could narrow the gap. Here are three that could outperform the AI chip leader in 2024. Image source: Getty Images. 1. Advanced Micro Devices If any semiconductor company is going to pose a challenge to Nvidia in AI capabilities, it seems likely to be Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD). The company's launch of its Instinct MI300 AI accelerators in December was highly anticipated, and the stock jumped 10% on the launch presentation, a sign Wall Street liked what it saw. Among the customers for the new component are Dell, Hewlett-Packard Enterprise, Lenovo, Microsoft, and Oracle, among others. AMD also said the Instinct Platform can offer a throughput increase of 60% for running inference on large language models compared with the Nvidia H100 HGX. AMD also made a number of acquisitions in the AI space recently. It acquired AI software leader Mipsology and Nod.ai, an open-source AI software expert, which will help it accelerate its deployment of AI solutions. AMD stock was no slouch in 2023. The stock jumped 128%. But expectations in 2024 are still modest, with the consensus calling for 16% revenue growth. If its new products take off, AMD could easily top that forecast and the stock could soar. 2. ACM Research ACM Research (NASDAQ: ACMR) is a relative unknown in the semiconductor sector. The company doesn't make chips, but instead makes machines that clean semiconductor wafers, an important process to ensure that these tiny components don't make errors. That position in the value chain makes ACM something of a picks-and-shovels play in the sector, but it also stands to benefit from the AI boom, since cleaning requirements are likely to become more technical as chips become more advanced and AI components become more in demand. ACM Research is a small company, with a market cap of $1.2 billion, but its recent results are impressive. Revenue rose 26% to $21.3 million, with a 31% increase in shipments even during a cyclically challenging period in the semiconductor industry. On the bottom line, adjusted net income rose 33% to $37.5 million. ACM is mostly focused on China, where it's considered a domestic supplier. That could give it an advantage at a time when a tech cold war between the U.S. and China is heating up, with the U.S. banning the export of some advanced technologies to China. The stock is cheap at a price-to-earnings ratio of 15, so it shouldn't take much to drive the stock higher in 2024, even after it gained 154% in 2023. 3. Taiwan Semiconductor Finally, Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE: TSM) also looks poised for a strong performance in 2024. Taiwan Semiconductor, also known as TSMC, is the world's largest contract semiconductor foundry, handling roughly half of semiconductor manufacturing for companies including Apple, Qualcomm, Broadcom, AMD, Nvidia, and Intel. AI makes up about 6% of the company's revenue, but given the company's strong position in chip manufacturing and even larger market share in the manufacturing of advanced chips, it should see steady growth ahead from increasing AI demand. Like other semiconductor companies, TSMC is fast at work increasing capacity to handle demand for AI production. That momentum may already be starting to build, given that revenue in October jumped 16% from the year before. Compared with the chip designers, TSMC stock is also affordably priced, at a price-to-earnings ratio of 20. With a broader recovery in the chip sector expected in 2024, TSMC could be a big winner.

"Yes, $1 trillion is a huge amount of money. It can, however, be hard to grasp exactly how big it is. So, here's an example: Imagine that $1 million was deposited into your bank account. Nice, right? Now, imagine deposits continued every hour, on the hour, every day and continued -- nonstop -- for 50 years. After all that time, you'd have $438 billion, a gargantuan amount of money. But to get to $1 trillion, the deposits would have to continue for another 65 years. To put it another way, it would take 115 years to accumulate $1 trillion in this fashion. Simply put, $1 trillion is an astoundingly large amount of dough. And yet, there are now five publicly traded American companies with market caps over $1 trillion. What's more, the two biggest -- Apple and Microsoft -- have market caps of $3 trillion and $2.8 trillion, respectively. Undoubtedly, many more companies will cross the $1 trillion mark in the years to come. And there's one I believe can get there by 2028: Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD). Image source: Getty Images. AMD's market cap is growing at a staggering pace Why do I think AMD can cross the $1 trillion mark by 2028? For starters, let's look at AMD's market cap today. As of this writing, AMD has a market cap of $238 billion, making it the 29th largest U.S. company, sandwiched between Salesforce and PepsiCo. So, to reach $1 trillion by 2028, AMD would need to grow its market cap at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 50% over the next four years: YEAR MARKET CAP IN BILLIONS (WITH 50% GROWTH RATE YOY) 2024 $238 2025 $357 2026 $536 2027 $803 2028 $1,205 Data source: Author's calculations. YOY = year over year. That would be an impressive feat, but consider this: AMD has grown its market cap over the last five years at a CAGR of 68%, rising from $17 billion in 2019 to more than $238 billion as of this writing. AMD Market Cap data by YCharts In other words, AMD just needs to maintain its market cap growth to hit the $1 trillion mark by 2028. That won't be easy, but it's certainly achievable. AMD could ride the artificial intelligence wave to a $1 trillion valuation What makes it possible -- perhaps even likely -- is the wild growth of the artificial intelligence (AI) market. As AMD CEO Lisa Su noted in a recent interview: The AI market over the last year has just exploded. ChatGPT has really changed our perspective for what Generative AI can do. ... We originally thought the total market for data center AI accelerators would be about $150 billion [in 2027]. Now, we think it will be over $400 billion. That's eye-popping growth, and it stands to be an enormous tailwind for AMD. Currently, the company generates roughly a quarter of its revenue from its data center unit. However, with demand for AI accelerators through the roof, that segment should see enormous revenue growth in the coming years -- in particular, due to the recent debut of its new adaptive processing unit chip, the MI300. Image source: The Motley Fool. In short, AMD is a company with the wind at its back. The AI revolution is just getting started, and for it to keep rolling on, many AI chips will be needed. And while AMD hopes to compete head-to-head with Nvidia for AI chip supremacy, there's plenty of room for both. And in time, AMD might just join Nvidia in the $1 trillion market cap club.

"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips What to do with $100,000? Where to invest that kind of money? These stocks to buy for 2024 include technology stocks, which continue to be a safe bet for growth-oriented investors. Of course, tech stocks are coming off their best year since the heady days of the internet bubble in 1999, with the Nasdaq index rising 43% in 2023. Despite the big rally, there’s still reason to be bullish on tech, semiconductor and microchip stocks in particular. These securities have a multi-year growth driver behind them in artificial intelligence (AI). While AI drove the Nasdaq higher last year, the technology is still in its infancy, and companies are only now starting to monetize it. Expect demand for AI microchips and semiconductors to continue growing as the technology changes the world. Here are three stocks to buy for the $100,000 portfolio: 2024 edition. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com Analysts at Stifel Financial (NYSE:SF) just upgraded their price target on shares of chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) from $145 to $170. The new price target implies a 20% upside for AMD stock from current levels after a 123% gain over the past 12 months. In December alone, AMD’s share price rose 20%. Stifel analysts cite AMD’s strong balance sheet and ties to secular trends such as AI as reasons to remain bullish on the stock. AMD stock has been a long-term winner for investors, gaining 650% over the past five years. The increase in 2023 was only about half the rise with rival chipmaker Nvidia‘s (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock; AMD has outpaced Nvidia over the past six months (24% vs. 12%) and appears to have momentum heading into 2024. AMD’s executives have also clarified that they are going all-in on AI, recently launching a new series of microchips called the “Ryzen 8040,” specifically for AI applications. Cadence Design Systems (CDNS) Source: mrinalpal / Shutterstock.com Now for a technology stock that most investors are likely unfamiliar with—Cadence Design Systems (NASDAQ:CDNS). Based in Silicon Valley and an ongoing concern since 1988, Cadence produces the software, hardware, and silicon pieces for designing and building integrated circuits, microchips and circuit boards. Think of them as creating the nuts and bolts of the microchip industry. While Cadence Design gets little attention, its stock is up 66% over the past 12 months and 510% over five years. Heading into 2024, Cadence Design Systems could be a good way to play the rally in chip and semiconductor stocks. The company’s earnings remain strong, and it has forecasted full-year 2023 revenue growth of 15% year-over-year and earnings per share (EPS) growth of 20%. Cadence is also flush with cash of $962 million and long-term debt of $649 million at the end of Q3 2023. CDNS stock isn’t cheap, trading at 75 times future earnings estimates, but the stock’s performance justifies the premium price. Micron Technology (MU) Source: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com Sticking with chipmakers, we have Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU). Its stock is up 12% in the past month after the company posted better-than-expected quarterly results. Over the last 12 months, MU stock has risen 66%, up 155% through five years. Not yet profitable, Micron reported a loss of $0.95 a share for its fiscal first quarter, which was better than the expected loss of $1.01 on Wall Street. Revenue totaled $4.73 billion, which beat analysts’ forecasts of $4.58 billion. Micron is a leader in dynamic random-access memory chips for desktop computers and servers, and flash memory in smartphones and hard drives. During itsearnings call the company’s management team gave a bullish outlook for AI, saying the technology should drive “multiyear growth.” Micron also said that inventory levels for its memory and storage chips are normal, and it’s working with Nvidia on upcoming AI chips—all music to investors’ ears. On the date of publication, Joel Baglole held long positions in NVDA and CDNS. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.

"Wall Street closed mixed on Tuesday, dragged down by tech and consumer discretionary stocks. The yield on the U.S. 10-year Treasury Note climbed to a two-week high. Two of the three major stock indexes ended in the red, while one ended in the green. How Did the Benchmarks Perform? The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) rose 25.5 points, or 0.1%, to close at 37,715.54. Eighteen components of the 30-stock index ended in positive territory, while 12 ended in positive. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite dropped 245.41 points, or 1.6%, to close at 14,765.94. The S&P 500 slid 27 points, or 0.6%, to close at 4,742.83. Five of the 11 broad sectors of the benchmark index closed in the red. The Technology Select Sector SPDR (XLK), the Industrials Select Sector SPDR (XLI) and the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR (XLY) declined 2.6%, 1% and 0.9%, respectively, while the Health Care Select Sector SPDR (XLV) advanced 1.8%. The fear-gauge CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) decreased 6% to 13.20. A total of 11.9 billion shares were traded on Tuesday, lower than the last 20-session average of 12.4 billion. Apple (AAPL) Weighs Down on the Tech Sector Shares of Apple Inc. AAPL declined 3.6% after Barclays downgraded the tech behemoth’s rating to “underweight”. The analysts cited weakening demand for the company’s flagship mobile iPhone 15 and almost zero upgrades to the iPhone 16 model as the main reason. Demand has been a major concern for the company since early 2023, and its holiday season sales forecast has also been below Wall Street estimates. Apple has also struggled in China’s market since the resurgence of Huawei. Being one of the “Magnificent Seven” stocks, Apple’s plight weighed down on the tech sector and the broader market in general. Consequently, shares of Microsoft Corporation MSFT and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. AMD fell 1.4% and 6%, respectively. Microsoft carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. 10-Year Treasury Yield Touches 2-Week High On Tuesday, the U.S. benchmark 10-year treasury yield climbed above the 4% mark to touch a 2-week high before settling at 3.937%. When treasury yields go up, future valuations of mega-cap growth stocks like tech seem unreasonable, and it weighs on the sector. Economic Data The U.S. Census Bureau reported that construction spending for November had increased 0.4% as opposed to a consensus of 0.6% for the period. The increase for October was revised up to 1.2% from the previously reported 0.6%.

"Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock. Shares of this chipmaker have returned +17.1% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +4% change. The Zacks Electronics - Semiconductors industry, to which Advanced Micro belongs, has gained 14.6% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term? While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making. Revisions to Earnings Estimates Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings. Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements. Advanced Micro is expected to post earnings of $0.77 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +11.6%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -1.6%. The consensus earnings estimate of $2.65 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -24.3%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.63 indicates a change of +37% from what Advanced Micro is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.4%. With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for Advanced Micro. The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate: 12 Month EPS Revenue Growth Forecast While earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth. For Advanced Micro, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $6.11 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +9.2%. For the current and next fiscal years, $22.63 billion and $26.06 billion estimates indicate -4.1% and +15.2% changes, respectively. Last Reported Results and Surprise History Advanced Micro reported revenues of $5.8 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +4.2%. EPS of $0.70 for the same period compares with $0.67 a year ago. Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.71 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.65%. The EPS surprise was +2.94%. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period. Valuation No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance. Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is. As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued. Advanced Micro is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade. Conclusion The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Advanced Micro. However, its Zacks Rank #4 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term. Zacks Names #1 Semiconductor Stock It's only 1/9,000th the size of NVIDIA which skyrocketed more than +800% since we recommended it. NVIDIA is still strong, but our new top chip stock has much more room to boom.

"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock was arguably the most important one on the market in 2023. Due to its weighting in the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 indices, it had a significant impact on their performance. Both set new all-time highs last year. Nvidia stock gained nearly 240% last year. It was the fifth largest and the second most influential component in the S&P 500 behind Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) It also was the fourth largest and the most influential component of the Nasdaq 100, just ahead of Tesla. The chip maker reached a $1 trillion valuation as a result. Now it’s a matter of when, not if, it hits $2 trillion. The Bull Case for Nvidia As the leading semiconductor company specializing in graphics cards and data centers, AI energized Nvidia’s performance. Its future performance in 2024 depends heavily on ongoing chip demand, its ability to innovate to maintain a competitive advantage, and whether AI has the legs to keep running higher. There is an excellent case that demand should grow. Businesses want in on AI, which ought to keep Nvidia busy. And PC sales could rebound with the potential for an AI PC being introduced this year. And the gaming market where Nvidia cut its teeth is showing signs of growth once more. Higher console sales, more games sold, and an increased number of players point to a recovery in the industry. Nvidia’s Q3 gaming revenue jumped 15% sequentially and 81% year over year. There is plenty Nvidia is doing right, too. Because Arm Holdings (NASDAQ:ARM) technology is so critical to its own, Nvidia invested in Arm’s IPO. Regulators prevented the two from merging over antitrust concerns, so this backdoor way of ensuring its access is the next best thing. Nvidia’s recently released Grace Hopper H200 AI Superchip is based on Arm’s architecture. The Bear Case for Nvidia NVDA stock already embodies the belief all that will fall in the chip maker’s favor. The stock is priced for perfection. Although only trading for 24 times next year’s earnings, it also goes for 27 times sales and 70 times free cash flow. With the U.S. blocking the sale and transfer of technology and chips to China and competitors nipping at its AI heels, any hiccup could cause NVDA stock to tumble. The country represents 20% of Nvidia’s data center revenue, one of its most important segments. Nvidia quickly established itself as the leading AI chip stock but Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and more recently Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) released competing processors. The H200 puts Nvidia back in the lead, but does so at a much higher price. Discounting by rivals could jeopardize NVDA’s lead. While the gaming market did bounce, the PC segment is still in decline. An AI PC might help, but that could be wishful thinking too. According to analysts, Nvidia has a median 12-month price target of $650, implying 35% upside in the stock. At least one analyst forecasts Nvidia stock will hit $1,100 per share, more than doubling from its current price of $495 per share. These optimistic projections are based on the assumption that Nvidia will continue to dominate the AI market, which is expected to grow at a 40.2% compounded annual growth rate between 2020 to 2027. The question is, how long is AI’s growth sustainable? Right now it’s on a rocket ride but that’s based on it continuing to pay dividends for business. If the hoped-for savings and efficiencies don’t materialize, that could cause demand to drop off the table. The Verdict on NVDA Stock Although momentum is in Nvidia’s favor, the stock is not a clear buy in 2024. It will be hard to keep the pace of growth going. The clarity needed regarding China is not imminent. Competition is growing and becoming more intense, particularly on the AI side. AI could be a bubble that bursts in 2024 due to regulatory, ethical, or social concerns. Yet I wouldn’t be selling shares either. Rather, for investors willing to tolerate the volatility and uncertainty in the market, the chip maker is a hold. Nvidia is a great company with a strong competitive advantage, but its stock is trading at a significant premium. With the saturation of its core markets, I’d be leery of buying more now On the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

"The video games market is vast, encompassing a wide range from consoles to PCs, mobile games, handheld devices, and more. Meanwhile, recent developments like microtransactions and subscription-based services have opened new ways for companies to boost revenue. According to Statista, the industry is valued at about $250 billion, and is expected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of about 9% through 2028. As a result, it's not a bad idea to make a long-term investment in the market and profit from its consistent development. After all, there's a reason many of the world's most valuable companies, including Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), Nvidia, and Apple, ventured into the lucrative arena. No matter the economic climate, there is almost always demand for new gaming content and hardware upgrades, offering companies and their investors reliable gains over the long term. Here are three top gaming stocks to buy in January. 1. Advanced Micro Devices Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) are up 127% over the last 12 months as the company impressed Wall Street with its artificial intelligence (AI) efforts. However, long before the company's venture into AI, AMD was a crucial fixture in the gaming community. The tech giant's computing hardware, including graphics processing units (GPUs) and central processing units (CPUs), is used by gamers worldwide to build high-powered gaming PCs. AMD's chips allow consumers to play demanding titles at far higher settings than possible on consoles. However, that hasn't stopped the company from also carving out a lucrative role in the console market. AMD is the exclusive supplier of chips to Sony's PlayStation 5 and Microsoft's Xbox Series X|S, two of the best-selling consoles of the last few years. AMD's success in video gaming pushed revenue in its gaming segment rise 30% to $1.5 billion over the last five years, with operating income up 72% to $208 million. Data by YCharts AMD looks too expensive with a forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 55. However, this table shows AMD's earnings could hit $5 per share by fiscal 2025. Multiplying that figure by the company's forward P/E gives a stock price of $275, projecting growth of 87% over the next two fiscal years. And with that, AMD is an attractive way to invest in gaming this month. 2. Microsoft As the home of the Xbox, Microsoft is one of the biggest names in video games. The company launched the brand with its first console in 2001, debuting as an underdog in an industry long dominated by Japanese firms Sony and Nintendo. However, Microsoft played to its strengths, using its skills in software to approach the market in a unique way. The tech giant was one of the first to launch a video game subscription service with Xbox Game Pass, which landed on the scene in 2017 and has been described as the Netflix for games. Game Pass made Xbox the best-valued console available, allowing gamers to pay one low monthly fee for access to an extensive library of new and old titles rather than paying for games individually. From 2020 to 2022, the number of Game Pass members rose 150% to 25 million. The platform's success has occurred as Microsoft acquired several game developers to boost content on the service, including purchasing Activision Blizzard (creators of Call of Duty) in 2023. Microsoft's forward P/E of 33 makes its stock a pricey option. However, as a behemoth in the video games industry, and free cash flow that hit $63 billion in 2023, the company has earned its premium price and is an attractive way to invest in video games this month. 3. Intel Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) might not be the first company that comes to mind in a discussion about gaming. However, like AMD, the chipmaker's CPUs have been heartily adopted by the video game community to run powerful gaming PCs. Additionally, in 2022, Intel took steps to diversify its position in gaming with the launch of its first consumer GPUs. Their debut had unfortunate timing, as macroeconomic headwinds had brought down the entire market. However, easing inflation last year suggests gaming GPU demand might be trending up again. In the third quarter of 2023, Intel's client computing segment (which includes gaming income) posted operating income growth of 43% to $2 billion. The company is on a promising growth trajectory, with excellent prospects in video games over the long term. Data by YCharts This chart shows Intel's earnings are projected to reach almost $3 per share over the next two fiscal years. In a similar calculation to AMD, multiplying the figure by Intel's forward P/E of 53 yields a stock price of $140. Considering the company's current position, its shares are projected to deliver growth of 180% by fiscal 2025. Intel could be one of the smartest ways to invest in video games this January.

"The artificial intelligence (AI) market exploded last year, becoming one of the fastest-growing industries. Data from Grand View Research shows the AI market is projected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of 37% through 2030, which would see it exceed a value of $1 trillion before the end of the decade. So it's no surprise that companies worldwide have restructured their businesses to focus on the budding sector, presenting a variety of investment opportunities. Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) are some of the most attractive options, with one making moves in AI chips and the other heavily investing in the software side of the industry. So let's take a look at whether AMD or Microsoft is currently the better stock for those who want to back the rapidly expanding AI market. Advanced Micro Devices Since its founding more than 50 years ago, AMD has become one of the biggest threats in chips. The company hasn't always been first to a market but has proven its ability to carve out a lucrative position in almost any part of the industry with its advanced technology and decisive leadership. AMD CEO Lisa Su took the helm in October 2014. Since then, the company's shares have soared over 4,000% as it has become a leader in central and graphics processing units (CPUs and GPUs). In fact, AMD's CPU market share has risen from 18% in 2017 to 35% in 2023, gradually chipping away at Intel's share. Meanwhile, the tech giant has attained a significant share of desktop GPUs, second only to Nvidia. As a result, AMD's expansion into AI strengthens its long-term outlook. Nvidia might have an estimated 90% market share in AI chips, but AMD's past performance suggests it will be able to secure a powerful role in the sector. AMD will begin shipping its MI300X GPU this year, designed specifically to challenge Nvidia's offerings. The AI chip already has Microsoft's Azure signed on as a customer, with AMD in talks with several other tech companies. It's still early days for AMD's AI journey, but it's likely to go far in the market in the coming years. Microsoft Microsoft got a head start in AI, investing $1 billion in ChatGPT developer OpenAI in 2019. The company has since increased that investment significantly and now boasts a 49% stake in the start-up. Microsoft's partnership with OpenAI has granted it access to some of the most advanced AI models, giving it an edge over rivals like Amazon and Alphabet. The Windows company has used OpenAI's technology to bring AI upgrades across its product lineup. Its cloud platform, Azure, has expanded its range of AI tools, search engine Bing has been improved with ChatGPT-like features, and various Office productivity services now promise to boost efficiency with the help of AI. Meanwhile, Microsoft has delivered impressive quarterly earnings. In the first quarter of 2024 (ending September 2023), the company posted revenue growth of 13% year over year, beating Wall Street forecasts by nearly $2 billion. Gains came from considerable growth in its productivity and cloud-related segments, which saw revenue increase by 13% and 19%, respectively. As the home of brands like Windows, Office, Azure, Xbox, and LinkedIn, Microsoft has a massive user base. Millions of businesses rely on its software, presenting considerable earning opportunities in AI. Is AMD or Microsoft the better AI stock? AMD and Microsoft have solid outlooks in AI over the long term. AMD looks poised to shake up the chip market with the launch of its new GPU. Meanwhile, Microsoft has the tech and brand loyalty to become the go-to for anyone looking to integrate AI into their workflow. However, the charts below suggest AMD might have more stock growth potential over the next two fiscal years. Data by YCharts These tables compare AMD's and Microsoft's EPS estimates for the next two fiscal years. According to the data, AMD's earnings could hit $5 per share by fiscal 2026, while Microsoft's will likely reach $15 per share. On the surface, Microsoft looks like a no-brainer. Yet multiplying those figures by AMD's forward price-to-earnings ratio of 55 and Microsoft's 34 yields stock prices of $275 and $510, respectively. Looking at their current positions, AMD's share would rise 87% and Microsoft's 36% over the next two fiscal years. As a result, AMD looks like the better AI stock right now and an attractive buy at the start of 2024. Should you invest $1,000 in Advanced Micro Devices right now?

"Chip stocks, including Nvidia (NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) have been on an absolute tear over the last 12 months, as investors remain extremely bullish on the artificial intelligence (AI) megatrend. Both AMD and Nvidia manufacture specialized chips that help power data centers for multiple AI platforms. While Nvidia stock more than tripled in 2023, AMD stock gained 127.6% last year. www.barchart.com However, a new analyst note today warns that NVDA could be vulnerable this year as the AI hype cycle tumbles into the so-called “trough of disillusionment” phase. With tech giants taking a dive to start the new year, let’s see which semiconductor stock has more upside potential for investors right now. The Bull Case for NVDA Stock Nvidia is well-positioned to benefit from the adoption of generative AI in the upcoming decade. In fiscal Q3 of 2024 (ended in October), Nvidia reported sales of $18.1 billion, an increase of 206% year over year. The majority of these gains were driven by Nvidia’s data center segment. Despite its massive size, analysts expect the company to increase sales by 118.4% to $59 billion in fiscal 2024 (ending in January) and by 56.5% to $92.3 billion in fiscal 2025. Comparatively, adjusted earnings per share are forecast to grow by 102.5% annually in the next five years. So, priced at 24.2 times forward earnings, NVDA stock is still quite cheap, given its stellar growth estimates. Market research company Gartner (IT) forecasts AI chip sales to surge to $67 billion in 2024, an increase of 25% year over year. Nvidia currently has a market share of almost 80% in this vertical, which means the business should generate revenue of around $54 billion in the next 12 months. These numbers could easily move higher if demand for AI chips continues to grow at an exponential rate. Out of the 35 analysts covering NVDA stock, 30 recommend “strong buy,” three recommend “moderate buy,” and two recommend “hold.” The average target price for NVDA is $653, indicating an upside potential of 37% from current levels. www.barchart.com The Bull Case for AMD Stock Valued at $221.7 billion by market cap, AMD has been among the hottest tech stocks in the past decade, rising a whopping 3,710% since January 2014. AMD’s CEO, Lisa Su, forecasts the data center AI chip vertical to grow from $45 billion in 2023 to $400 billion in 2027, providing it with enough room to grow its top line in the next four years. In addition to AI, AMD is poised to benefit from growth in its legacy businesses, such as graphics and enterprise processors. Similar to several other tech stocks, AMD wrestled with slowing PC sales, higher costs, elevated interest rates, and lower enterprise spending. It also faced challenges in China, due to restrictions on exports by the U.S. government. Due to a challenging macro environment, AMD’s sales are forecast to decline by 4% year over year to $22.65 billion in 2023. However, revenue might rise by 16.6% to $26.4 billion in 2024. Comparatively, adjusted earnings per share is forecast to expand from $2.65 in 2023 to $3.73 in 2024. Priced at 39.5 times forward earnings, AMD trades at a much higher multiple compared to NVDA. However, it's growing at a much slower pace. Out of the 29 analysts covering AMD stock, 23 recommend “strong buy,” one recommends “moderate buy,” and five recommend “hold.” However, the average target price for AMD is $135.07, which is fractionally below the stock's current levels - suggesting that Wall Street sees more upside ahead for NVDA relative to AMD over the next year. www.barchart.com On the date of publication, Aditya Raghunath did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips The semiconductor industry took the world by storm in 2023, and I believe it will continue to remain a highlight of this year too. It is hard to imagine a world without semiconductor chips, and if you want to make the most of the ample potential these companies have, it is best to invest in semiconductor stocks. You should especially consider the hottest semiconductor stocks that we have listed here! Analysts expect a steady expansion of this industry, and as the economy improves, we could see companies report stellar financials. This is still an early stage for the industry and it has many years of growth. So, if you haven’t had a chance to buy Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock before it soared by more than 200%, you can still look for the hottest semiconductor stocks that have solid long-term potential. Let’s take a look at them. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is Nvidia’s biggest competitor and it is taking giant strides in the industry. While 2023 may not have been a blockbuster year for the company, it is set to rebound this year. It is expected that PC sales will rise again, and we could see AMD report better sales revenue from the same since the company supplies chips for PCs. Additionally, the third quarter revenue was up 8% quarter over quarter, and the EPS was up 21%. This shows that the company is gaining ground and improving its business performance. Top tech giants including Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) have announced the adoption of AMD’s chips and this is a strong shift from Nvidia’s chips. That said, companies not willing to wait for weeks to get their hands on Nvidia chips will be happy to use AMD’s latest AI chips. AMD stock is up over 100% in the year and has generated more than 600% returns in the past five years. This speaks a lot about the strength of the business to survive amidst all market conditions. Trading at $135 today, the stock looks undervalued to me. Stifel Financial (NYSE:SF) analyst has upgraded the price target for the stock from $145 to $170 and this shows a 20% upside from the current level. AMD has everything it takes to be a long-term investment. It has a solid history, exceptional leadership, and the ability to survive any storm. As the demand for PCs improves, we could see AMD report impressive numbers. It can be a long-term winner, but you must have the patience to hold on to it. Intel (INTC) Source: Kate Krav-Rude / Shutterstock.com A hot semiconductor stock for 2024, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) benefits from the CHIPS Act. However, it hasn’t been able to impress investors with the financials. However, this year could be different. The company will launch Gaudi 3, an AI accelerator that is expected to beat Nvidia’s chips in data centers. Additionally, the company launched an independent AI company, Articul8 AI, in collaboration with DigitalBridge Group. The company will offer secure and cost-effective AI solutions to enterprises. Financial details about the company aren’t disclosed yet, but this move can help Intel expand its market share. While Intel has been late to enter the AI race, if the chips are worth the hype, we could see a strong improvement in Intel’s business. The company has been around for a while and they do know how to run a business, but the AI industry is getting highly competitive, and it is time to prove their worth. The company is also expanding its manufacturing facility in Ireland and Oregon. INTC stock is up 69% in the year but relatively flat in the past five years. I believe the company will be able to sustain the current momentum, and we could see a slow but steady upside from the current level of $47. Stifel Financial analyst also increased the price target from $38 to $45 and has a hold rating on the stock. The analyst finds the semiconductor stock attractive as we head into 2024. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com A well-known name in the semiconductor industry, Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSMC) is one of the hottest semiconductor stocks to own. It makes chips for the biggest tech giants including Nvidia, and holds more than 50% of the market share in the semiconductor space. It benefits from the CHIPS Act and is building a plant in Arizona to make the most of it. While this has impacted the earnings, it still has an upside potential. As the world’s leading semiconductor foundry, TSMC has the expertise and leadership to continue expanding its market share. One big reason to invest in the stock is that the company doesn’t produce chips for general sale but caters to other companies to meet their needs. This means it will have a steady revenue flow throughout the year. If the demand for PCs and smartphones improves, the company could see a significant improvement in the chip demand. The stock is up 31% in the year and is exchanging hands for $100. I believe TSMC is a long-term stock to buy and hold.

"2023 was the year of artificial intelligence (AI) investing, and perhaps the biggest winners were the ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks, a moniker that includes mega-cap behemoths Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Nvidia, Tesla, and Meta Platforms. One of the biggest standouts among this cohort was semiconductor company Nvidia, which saw its market cap balloon to more than $1 trillion, fueled by unprecedented demand for chips used to train generative AI models. While each of the companies above has a multitude of ways to benefit from AI tailwinds, savvy investors should know that myriad opportunities exist in the capital markets. One such company that looks set up to dominate in 2024 is Nvidia's top rival, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD). While the company's growth in 2023 paled in comparison to Nvidia's, AMD may have just made its best countermove yet, setting up 2024 to be a milestone year. Let's dig into what AMD has in the cards, and why scooping up shares now could be a lucrative opportunity. AMD's answer to Nvidia In early December, AMD released a new line of AI chips. The cornerstone of the product release was the MI300X, AMD's biggest answer yet to Nvidia's unrelenting graphics processing units (GPUs) operation. During the unveiling, AMD's CEO Lisa Su made a bold declaration when she called the MI300X ""the most advanced AI accelerator in the industry."" If that doesn't get you excited, let's check out some of the use cases around the MI300X accelerator that support Su's high degree of confidence. Microsoft is going to use the MI300X for applications in its leading cloud platform Azure, a strategy that could further propel the dominance of ChatGPT. Remember, Microsoft previously made a massive $10 billion investment in OpenAI, the parent company of ChatGPT. Moreover, with the release of its new CoPilot offering, Microsoft's plans to integrate ChatGPT throughout its ecosystem are becoming increasingly clear. Therefore, it's likely the Windows developer will be highly selective with its vendor partners to ensure its massive investments in AI pay off. Another noteworthy partnership includes Meta, which announced that it will be using the MI300X for AI inferencing. This is important because these use cases could be early indications that AMD's newest chips will be a bellwether for data center business -- a market that is largely dominated by Nvidia right now. Image Source: Getty Images How much growth can AMD expect? Following the public release of the MI300X, Su sat down with CNBC to speak in more detail about how these chips could represent the next frontier of growth. More specifically, Su said that she believes the addressable market for data center AI accelerators will reach $400 billion by 2027. To put this figure in perspective, during AMD's Q3 earnings call management guided for $2 billion in data center GPU revenue for 2024. Although this looks like a low forecast relative to the potential size of the market, I'm not worried for AMD. Given the sky-high demand for Nvidia's GPUs, the company has made significant investments in manufacturing and production. I see this as an opportunity for AMD to make inroads in the data center AI market and acquire additional market share. Why? Because as Nvidia's backlog continues to grow, I see customers diversifying their GPU needs and turning to more than one provider. So while Nvidia may dominate the space right now, I think AMD has a greenfield opportunity to provide customers with commensurate (if not superior) technology, and do so at a potentially lower cost and faster delivery time. For this reason, I see AMD's forecast of $2 billion in data center GPU revenue to be conservative. Furthermore, I am incredibly bullish that this figure could grow exponentially in just a few years. Is AMD stock going parabolic? AMD stock rocketed 123% during 2023. Yet Hans Mosesmann of Rosenblatt Securities sees another 45% upside for AMD stock, giving it a price target of $200. Don't worry too much about whether AMD reaches or exceeds this price target in 2024. Rather, ask yourself if you believe in the long-term secular trend of AI, and if AMD is well positioned to benefit. I think the MI300X came at just the right time. While Nvidia is the dominant player in AI GPUs, AMD has a unique opportunity to capitalize on unprecedented demand in the data center space in particular. Investors should view AI as more of a marathon than a sprint, keeping in mind that AMD spent a good portion of 2023 making strategic acquisitions, which haven't been fully integrated or monetized yet. So while AMD's current growth is not as exciting as that of its larger counterpart, its roadmap is hard to ignore. Moreover, as various applications for GPU technology begin to take shape, I see AMD emerging as a formidable leader in the space. If you're looking for alternatives to Nvidia or seeking hedges to other AI plays in your portfolio, I wouldn't sleep on AMD. In fact, given the early positive indications of MI300X's demand, 2024 could end up being a massive year for the chip company, and represent the beginning of a long-term strong force in data center AI.

"Party like it's 1999: That's what many stocks in the Nasdaq-100 did in 2023. The index delivered its biggest gains since the end of the 20th century, skyrocketing nearly 54%. The sizzling momentum could fade for some Nasdaq stocks. Others, though, could keep the good times rolling, and some laggards could rebound, based on analysts' projections. Here are three Nasdaq-100 stocks Wall Street thinks will soar another 29% or more in 2024. 1. Warner Bros. Discovery Warner Bros. Discovery (NASDAQ: WBD) started 2023 with a bang, with its shares jumping as much as 68% by late February. Although the stock subsequently gave up much of those early gains, it still ended the year up 20%. Several analysts look for Warner Bros. Discovery to bounce back in 2024. The average 12-month price target is 36% above the company's current share price. The big story for Warner Bros. Discovery right now is its discussions about a potential merger with Paramount Global. A combination of the two companies would create an entertainment giant but would also increase Warner Bros. Discovery's debt load. With Warner's total debt already approaching $45 billion, it's understandable why investors aren't exactly enamored with the idea of a merger with Paramount. Should a deal be announced, we could see some revisions to Wall Street's price targets. 2. Nvidia Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) ranked as the hottest Nasdaq-100 stock last year. Shares of the chipmaker more than tripled on surging demand for its graphics processing units (GPUs). Wall Street doesn't expect Nvidia to keep up that torrid pace in 2024. But analysts nonetheless anticipate another great performance. The consensus 12-month price target reflects an upside potential of 33%. The boom in generative artificial intelligence (AI) shows no signs of ending anytime soon. That should translate into sustained demand for Nvidia's GPUs, which are widely viewed as the gold standard for powering AI apps. There's one potential fly in the ointment, though. Rivals including Advanced Micro Devices and customers such as Alphabet's Google Cloud are rolling out their own powerful AI chips. Nvidia's almost total dominance of the market might come to an end in the not-too-distant future. 3. PayPal Holdings Not every Nasdaq-100 stock was a solid winner in 2023. PayPal Holdings' (NASDAQ: PYPL) shares sank nearly 14% last year after plunging 62% in 2022. The fintech pioneer could have a light at the end of the tunnel, though, if Wall Street is right. The average analysts' 12-month price target for PayPal is more than 29% above the current share price. Despite the dismal stock performance in recent years, PayPal's underlying business appears to be in pretty good shape. The company's net revenue rose 8% year over year in the third quarter of 2023. Adjusted earnings per share soared 20%. Total payment volume jumped 15%. There's still uncertainty for PayPal, though. The company has a new leadership team. Competition in the digital payments market is intensifying. Its business loans portfolio has deteriorated. But with a price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio of only 0.51, PayPal's valuation looks quite attractive and reflects analysts' expectations of more robust growth in the future.

"The graphics card market is no longer a duopoly. Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) launched its first discrete family of graphics cards in late 2022. While the launch was bumpy, the company managed to offer a compelling value proposition for gamers in the budget portion of the market. Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is still the market leader by far, and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) is in a distant second place. Intel has gained a small foothold, but only in the budget portion of the market. The company's issues with buggy software drivers, particularly soon after launch, have likely driven some gamers away. Another shot in 2024 Intel's first generation of graphics cards made no attempt to compete with Nvidia and AMD at higher price points. The Arc A750 sells today for around $210, and the Arc A770 goes for around $320, although prices have dipped lower at times. These cards are competitive for the price, although performance can be inconsistent due to nagging driver issues. Helping Intel in 2023 were lackluster mid-range graphics card launches from both Nvidia and AMD. Nvidia's RTX 4060 and RTX 4060 Ti came with limitations and high price tags. Tom's Hardware concluded that the priciest variant was ""overpriced for what you get, much like most of the rest of Nvidia's current RTX 40-series lineup."" AMD's efforts weren't much better. The RX 7600 wasn't much of an upgrade over previous models, and the value proposition, compared to last-gen products, was weak, even after a last-minute price cut. While Nvidia is expected to roll out a product refresh soon, genuinely new mid-range graphics cards from Nvidia and AMD likely won't be coming until 2025. The gap between Nvidia's RTX 3060 and RTX 4060 was more than two years, and the RTX 4060 has only been on the market since mid-2023. AMD may fill in some gaps in its lineup in 2024, but next-generation products are likely a ways off. Intel's next-generation graphics cards, codenamed Battlemage, are expected to arrive sometime in 2024. With Battlemage, Intel is expected to move up into the enthusiast portions of the market that its first-generation products avoided. While Intel probably won't be going toe-to-toe with Nvidia's highest-end products, Battlemage should appeal to a broader swath of gamers. Intel proved with its first-generation products that it can produce capable graphics hardware. With its second-generation products, it must prove that it's committed enough to the market to continually improve its software and eliminate the bugs and inconsistencies that have been holding it back. A multibillion-dollar opportunity Jon Peddie Research expects the market for discrete graphics cards to grow to $39 billion by 2026. That estimate was thrown out in late 2022 before the artificial intelligence (AI) bonanza caused demand for data center GPUs to explode. Considering just the market for graphics cards aimed at gaming, however, that's likely still a reasonable estimate. In addition to winning a portion of the graphics card market, Intel's increased work on graphics can benefit it in other ways. The company's Meteor Lake CPUs, which launched in December for laptops, feature revamped integrated GPUs that deliver enormous performance gains. One set of benchmarks, for example, shows a 33% performance gain and a doubling of power efficiency over previous-generation models. Intel has long lagged AMD in terms of integrated graphics performance, but that gap now appears to be closing. While Intel's initial graphics card launch didn't go smoothly, the software situation has greatly improved over the past year. Whenever the company manages to get Battlemage out the door, it will be in a good position to increase its market share and cement its status as a viable alternative to Nvidia and AMD.

"Server and storage system manufacturer Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI) has gone from an under-followed value stock to a top pick among investors looking to bet on artificial intelligence (AI). 2023 was an excellent year: The stock soared nearly 250% higher. By all indications, Super Micro could still be a great value right now. But I'm passing once again on this data center and enterprise compute manufacturer. Here are three reasons why. 1. Super Micro is sitting on a massive opportunity, but so is everyone else Super Micro's head of steam has been building thanks to generative AI. Chip companies like Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), AMD (NASDAQ: AMD), and Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) have been tapping the manufacturer to assemble servers (a powerful computer that gets installed in a data center or business office) that power AI applications. It's also getting in on the Arm Holdings data center server game and has a new lineup of servers using chip design start-up Ampere Computing Arm-based chips. Super Micro just upgraded its revenue guidance for 2024, with expectations for it to be in a range between $10 billion and $11 billion -- versus $9.5 billion to $10.5 billion before. The dramatic rise thanks to AI is especially clear when viewing sales over the last five years. Super Micro was hauling in only a few billion dollars in revenue just three years ago. Data by YCharts. However, Super Micro competes against many other companies that design and assemble servers and storage devices on behalf of its semiconductor design and manufacturing partners. Competitors include Cisco Systems, Dell Technologies, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, and a growing presence in the server market from equipment and design manufacturers in Asia like Foxconn and Inspur. All these peers are also sitting on a massive generative AI opportunity. Super Micro is clearly a standout as it has gone from a small and relatively unknown company to a hot stock riding the AI wave. But I can't ignore the hotly competitive field that Super Micro battles in. 2. It's all about forward earnings growth, but not Super Micro's own growth At this point, given the sustained growth Super Micro is expecting, many investors are drawn to the cheap valuation -- especially when comparing it to the premium price chip stocks like Nvidia and AMD are fetching these days. Indeed, Super Micro could be a great long-term value right now. Shares trade for 26 times trailing 12-month earnings per share (EPS), but only 16 times expected EPS for fiscal 2024. That compares to the respective 24 and 27 times expected EPS for Nvidia and AMD for next year. Data by YCharts. However, Super Micro's growth is not coming from its own efforts. Rather, it's riding the coattails of others, primarily leaders in semiconductor design, as it makes hay from the AI movement. No matter how you slice it, Super Micro is dependent on ultimate sales of AI servers powered by partners like Nvidia and AMD, making it a type of derivative bet on those businesses' performance. That's a big reason for the relative discount on Super Micro stock. 3. Super Micro admits it has some key disadvantages Nevertheless, Super Micro is raking in the chips thanks to AI, and its stock is a relative value. So why not just buy? For me, it's all about the business model. Super Micro is not in full control of its own destiny. It could be very cheap if growth continues, but that growth and resulting profitability will be dependent on chip design partners Nvidia, AMD, and the like -- and less on Super Micro's own execution. Again, by Super Micro's own admission in its financial filings, it has limited ability to stave off competitors over the long term. In the last annual filing, Super Micro said the following (italics inserted by me): We seek to protect our intellectual property rights with a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secret laws, and disclosure restrictions. We rely primarily on trade secrets, technical know-how, and other unpatented proprietary information relating to our design and product development activities. In other words, the majority of Super Micro's work has no patent protection, which is a key item I look for when investing in hardware-based businesses (like semiconductor stocks). Although Super Micro certainly has its own proprietary way of designing and assembling enterprise computing and storage systems, few of those processes are granted patent and intellectual property (IP) protection. Again, by Super Micro's own admission in its last annual filing: Our industry is marked by a large number of patents, copyrights, trade secrets and trademarks and by frequent litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violation of intellectual property rights. Our primary competitors have substantially greater numbers of issued patents than we have which may position us less favorably in the event of any claims or litigation with them. Other third parties have in the past sent us correspondence regarding their intellectual property or filed claims that our products infringe or violate third parties' intellectual property rights. In addition, increasingly non-operating companies are purchasing patents and bringing claims against technology companies. We have been subject to several such claims and may be subject to such claims in the future. When looking for a long-term investment in AI, and in whatever other mega trends lie ahead for the greater IT sector, I can't say ""yes"" to owning every stock. This kind of risk and lack of competitive differentiation inherent in Super Micro's business model just doesn't cut it for me. Besides, I already own ample shares of Nvidia, AMD, and data center design leader Arista Networks, so buying Super Micro would offer little in the form of portfolio diversification for me. I understand the draw to Super Micro stock as 2024 gets underway, and the swarm of investors betting on the company could be right in assuming it will be a big beneficiary from the AI movement. But as for me, I'm passing on Super Micro stock again in 2024. Should you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?

"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Like most other tech stocks, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) has been off to a rough start for 2024. After reaching prices nearing $150 per share in late December, AMD stock has since slid back to around $135 per share. The general direction of the broad market has played a role in this. However, valuation-related worries have also been a factor. AMD continues to trade at a moderately high premium to its main peer, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). This comes despite the fact that Nvidia has made far more commercial progress in the area of AI-compatible chips. But while these factors suggest that declines are more likely than further gains in 2024 for AMD shares, it’s not necessarily set in stone that things play out this way. There’s still a path to further gains for the stock. Why? Let’s take a closer look and find out. AMD Stock and the Latest Round of Bearishness As seen from AMD’s latest price performance, the stock is experiencing another round of bearishness. Again, much of this is in tandem with investor sentiment about the broad market. The November and December rally has given way to a January sell-off, as the market re-assess how much the macro picture will improve this year. This negative sentiment shift could carry on in the near-term, having a further impact on the valuation of AMD stock. Alongside this, the other aforementioned factor affecting AMD’s price performance may not be waning in impact, either. Valuation concerns have only just now had an effect, despite commentators from Barron’s and elsewhere expressing them a month ago. Possibly in “priced for perfection” territory, if Advanced Micro Devices falls short of expectations, when it releases its latest results/updates to guidance later this month, investors could use it as justification to make their exit from the stock. Then again, maybe not. Although the skeptics may think that it’s the beginning of the end for AMD’s incredible AI-driven run-up, that’s not necessarily the case. Subsequent developments related to the company’s move into chips for the generative AI market could instead provide more runway. The Ingredients are in Place for Another Banner Year At present, the price-to-forward-earnings ratio for AMD stock is approximately 51. NVDA stock has a forward earnings ratio of only 38.9. On the surface, this suggests that AMD is overvalued, given that it’s Nvidia, not Advanced Micro Devices, that has already capitalized on the AI chips trend. Still, this may be a short-sighted takeaway. AMD’s management has been quite conservative in its AI-related sales forecasts. Back in October, CEO Lisa Su forecasted that the company would sell $2 billion worth of its Instinct MI300 accelerators in 2024. However, AMD could ship 400,000 units of this chip this year. With comparable chips from Nvidia selling for tens of thousands per unit, clearly there’s room for the MI300 to have an outsized impact on AMD’s fiscal results this year. That’s not all. As discussed recently, the company has another promising AI chip product: its Ryzen 8040 Series processors for laptops. Put it all together, and AMD clearly has the ingredients in place for another banner year. The company could “beat and raise” in the quarters ahead, the sell-side could continue raising their earnings forecasts, and the market may carry on factoring in future growth into the stock price. The Verdict If weakness persists with AMD shares in the coming weeks, this may work to your advantage. That’s not to say that you’ll be able to buy this stock at prices last hit in January 2023, but the recent pullback, or any pullback ahead of earnings, may prove to be a solid entry point. Considering Advanced Micro Devices’ latest product launches, plus continued strong demand trends for AI chips, chances are this month’s quarterly earnings release will unveil positive surprises rather than major disappointment. As the months progress, and the company not merely meets, but beats, AI-related expectations, the stock could re-hit its high water mark ($161.91 per share), then keep heading up to new highs. Hence, do not get scared off by the macro doom-and-gloom, or by the valuation skeptics. Make AMD stock a buy instead. AMD stock earns an A rating in Portfolio Grader.

"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips The year 2023 was a great one for the stock market. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 14% to finish the year at a record high. The benchmark S&P 500 index gained 25% and came within a whisker of a record close. And the technology-focused Nasdaq index increased 43% to register its best year since the internet rally of 1999. So, what can we expect in 2024? How will the markets perform in the year ahead? It’s still very early days, but already we are seeing some trends and shifts take hold in the market. The winners and losers of the past year could change in the coming months as investor preferences shift and sentiment takes a different turn. Interest rate cuts, wars in foreign lands, and a potential global recession could each influence markets over the next 12 months. As the New Year begins, we offer 2023 in review: key stock trends and sector shifts unveiled. Bank Stocks Are Hot Again As soon as Fed Chair Jerome Powell announced that three interest rate cuts are likely in 2024, the sun began to shine on bank stocks. Despite their earnings holding up well, bank stocks, as a group, had a miserable 2023. The S&P Banks Index has registered a measly 2% return over the last 12 months, compared to a 25% gain in the benchmark S&P 500 index. And that small gain in the banking index was achieved after Powell announced the potential rate cuts in December. Of course, things really got ugly for all bank stocks after the failures of several regional lenders last spring, including Silicon Valley Bank (OTCMKTS:SIVBQ) and Signature Bank (OTCMKTS:SBNY). However, investors and traders are now putting capital back into bank stocks, with interest rates having now peaked and likely to decline in the coming months. Since the start of the fourth quarter of 2023 last October, the S&P Banks Index has climbed 30% higher and turned positive, with most of that increase occurring in the last month. Influential bank stocks such as JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) are each up 10% since the start of December. BioTech Is Having A Moment Another beneficiary of the expected rate cuts this year appears to be biotech stocks. The equal-weighted SPDR S&P Biotech ETF (NYSEARCA:XBI) has risen 38% since the broader market began to rally at the end of October. The gain is a major reversal for the biotech sector. Before Halloween, the biotech ETF was down 20% on the year. But now, biotech stocks are rallying again as the prospect of lower interest rates comes into view. This makes sense as most biotech stocks, the majority of which are small start-ups, rely on borrowed capital to fund their operations and drug research. In addition to the overall rally among biotech stocks, there has also been a fresh wave of mergers and acquisitions among biotech companies over the last two months. And there are reports that biotech executives are buying up company shares as the stocks rally, providing a further boost of confidence for the sector. On the first trading day of 2024, as the technology-laden Nasdaq index suffered its worst performance since last October, shares of biopharmaceutical company Moderna (NASDAQ:MRNA) rose 13% on news of an analyst upgrade. MRNA stock has now risen 37% since the beginning of December. Microchip and Semiconductor Stocks Are Pulling Back Fueled by the hype surrounding artificial intelligence (AI), stocks of microchip and semiconductor companies led the market higher in 2023. Shares of Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) increased 238% last year, while the stock of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) rose 125%. Now, though, it appears that stocks of chip and semiconductor companies are pulling back. AMD stock has dropped 9% since the last trading day of 2023, while NVDA stock has fallen 5% and appears unable to break above resistance at $500 a share. Other chip and semi stocks are also sliding lower to start 2024. This could be the result of short-term profit-taking or the start of a bigger rotation out of tech and a move away from the AI trade that dominated markets last year. It will take some time to play out, but this type of sector rotation is common in the market. In 2022, stocks of oil and gas companies dominated only to become among the worst performers last year as investors dumped big oil in favor of big tech.

"Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) were surging last month after investors responded positively to the launch of its new Instinct MI300 accelerators designed to run advanced artificial intelligence (AI) models. The launch had been long anticipated by investors. AMD stock also benefited from broader market gains during the month, partly in response to the Fed's forecast of lower interest rates in 2024. According to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence, the stock gained 22% in December. As you can see from the chart below, AMD spiked 10% on Dec. 7 after its chip presentation and continued to rise from there. AMD data by YCharts. AMD responds in AI Rival Nvidia has dominated the market thus far for AI chips and components, only increasing the anticipation for the new MI300 and the rest of AMD's new product line. There's a shortage of Nvidia's H100 accelerators and other graphics processing units (GPUs), meaning there's a clear opportunity for AMD to step in. AMD said the new MI300X accelerator offers industry-leading memory bandwidth for generative AI and top performance for large language model training and inference. AMD also projected that the new line of chips would generate $2 billion in revenue in 2024, which would significantly boost its data center business. The company also showed off customers, including Microsoft, Meta Platforms, OpenAI, and Oracle, showing a solid customer base for the new product line. Later in the month, there was little company-specific news on AMD, but the stock seemed to benefit from the broader gains in the morning as the Fed forecast lower rates next year. AMD also seemed to get a boost from better-than-expected results from Micron, the memory-chip maker considered a bellwether for the broader semiconductor market. Micron reported a return to revenue growth, though it still had a wide loss on the bottom line. What's next for AMD in 2024 High expectations are baked into AMD's stock after shares more than doubled in 2023, and the $2 billion revenue forecast from the new MI300 shows that alone will only have a modest impact on the company's financial results. The semiconductor sector has been in a slump in the last year or two, and AMD reported just 4% revenue growth in its most recent quarter, but demand for its CPUs seems to be recovering as well. Given the surge in demand for AI chips and the current shortage, AMD should find a niche to fill and remain a popular choice for tech investors.

"To say that 2023 was a good year for semiconductor stocks is an understatement. The sector, at least as defined by the VanEck Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ: SMH), rocketed 73.4% in 2023! So if you had shied away from this volatile yet important part of the market, you likely missed out on some of the biggest gains of the year. The artificial intelligence (AI) revolution no doubt played a big part, causing some of the largest names like Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices to rise 239% and 128%, respectively. But there are other, really important chip companies with strong business models and important long-term growth trends that lagged the sector. On that note, the following three stocks still look like bargain-priced options in the red-hot sector today. SMH Year to Date Total Returns (Daily) data by YCharts. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing The world's largest chip foundry Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) was up ""only"" 42.3% in 2023, including its 1.9% dividend. But that left the stock only trading around 18 times trailing earnings and under 16 times this year's earnings estimates. That's certainly a more-than-reasonable price to pay for the world's largest foundry that makes basically all of the world's most important chips, from Nvidia's H100 accelerators to AMD's Instinct MI300 to Apple's M-series laptop and A-series mobile processors. 2023 was a down year for many key semiconductor markets, including both PCs and smartphones, which are still the largest chip end markets today. Investors became disappointed in TSMC's results mid-year after second-quarter earnings when management revealed that AI chips made by Nvidia only made up a mid-single-digit percentage of the overall industry. Given how huge Nvidia's growth was last year, that appeared to surprise some investors, who may have been hoping for a bigger AI surge for TSMC. But TSMC stock clawed its way back toward the end of the year when growth surprised to the upside. In its Q2 earnings call with analysts, TSMC management revised down prior guidance for the year, anticipating revenue would fall around 10% for the year. However, things turned out much better than anticipated, as AI demand remained very strong while other key markets started to turn around. TSMC releases its monthly revenue, and through November, its 11-month revenue was only 4.1% below that of 2022 -- much better than the anticipated 10% decline. Eventually, all of those laptops and smartphones bought during the 2020 to 2021 pandemic period will have to be replaced, likely by higher-end chips for AI PCs and other advanced machines. Furthermore, AMD's CEO Lisa Su just increased her outlook for the AI chip market to $400 billion by 2027, up from her June prediction of just $150 billion. While TSMC said it expects AI chips to grow from a mid-single-digit percentage of its revenue to a mid-teens percentage over time, that is probably conservative. With a larger AI market growing very fast as other markets are turning around, look for TSMC to post strong growth in the year ahead. On Semiconductor The electric vehicle (EV) market is projected for long-term growth, especially as technology improves and costs come down. But 2023 saw a slowdown in the market, causing many EV-related stocks to plunge in Q2 and Q3, like silicon carbide leader On Semiconductor (NASDAQ: ON). This year, the supply chain shortages that plagued the industry in 2021 and 2022 were alleviated, leading to ample supply. Meanwhile, higher interest rates dampened demand for EVs, which tend to be a bit pricier than the typical internal combustion engine (ICE). A late summer report showed that EV inventories were piling up at dealerships in the U.S., with some major automakers saying they would slow their battery and EV manufacturing plans. Those fears appeared justified when On reported Q3 earnings, during which it guided for a soft Q4. On is currently a leader in silicon carbide power chips, a difficult-to-manufacture semiconductor alloy that is especially useful in high-power applications, like electric vehicles and infrastructure. The company blamed the slowdown on a very large European customer that had paused some orders, which isn't surprising given the news about slower adoption of certain EV models. But fears that EVs have exhausted early adopters may be misplaced. After all, despite the slowdown, EVs are still growing faster than ICE cars in the U.S., Europe, and China -- just not as fast as some more bullish observers may have anticipated. And as interest rates moderate and charging infrastructure improves, customer adoption should eventually be there. So near-term fears may have opened up an opportunity for longer-term investors in On. After all, the stock only trades at less than 16 times earnings. Moreover, the company is set to improve margins as it brings its new 300mm East Fishkill plant up to speed, so there is also a self-help, margin-improvement story here as well. Image source: Getty Images. Kulicke and Soffa The AI revolution has put a big focus on whichever chipmaker can produce the fastest and most power-efficient chip at the most advanced node. But investors shouldn't ignore chip-packaging companies either, such as industry leader Kulicke and Soffa (NASDAQ: KLIC). These types of companies are somewhat less sexy and use more commoditized machines that connect chips together on a motherboard or even to each other, usually through copper wires or small copper ""bumps."" But as chips become more complex, a greater focus will come on packaging. This is especially true as power and electricity concerns come to the fore, since more powerful chips require more electricity and generate more heat. AI chipmakers are even beginning to construct chips made of ""chiplets,"" which are optimized pieces of silicon stitched together, with new, advanced packaging technologies, into ""superchips."" For instance, AMD's MI300 is made out of 13 different chiplets. Kulicke and Soffa has a dominant market position in ""legacy"" ball bonder packaging equipment, demand for which fluctuates with cycles. But it has smaller revenue segments in newer up-and-coming technologies, such as thermocompression bonding for chiplets, EV battery packaging, and microLEDs -- a new kind of advanced screen that is currently in high-end electronics but could one day eventually spread to smartphones. Not unlike TSMC, Kulicke's mature business in ball bonding is in a downcycle, causing a massive decline in earnings over the past year, from $7.09 in 2022 to just $0.99 in 2023. But if those are the two extremes, one could argue Kulicke's average earnings power is around $4 per share. With the stock at just $51.50 with nearly $13.40 in cash on the balance sheet with no debt, the company's enterprise value (around $38 per share) to average earnings ($4) would be under 10. That's a cheap stock no matter which way you cut it, making Kulicke and Soffa an under-the radar pick in 2024. Should you invest $1,000 in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing right now?

"The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite gained some 43% in 2023. And investors are hopeful it will rally further as excitement continues to increase around generative artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. Expectations about interest rate cuts should also push up the Nasdaq in 2024. Against this backdrop, it makes sense for retail investors to consider picking up small stakes in high-quality blue chip stocks that are already riding robust secular tailwinds ahead of this potential rally. Here's why Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) fit the bill. Microsoft For a long time, Microsoft has been widely famous for its Windows operating system and its Microsoft Office productivity suite. But lately, the company has also become famous for its Azure cloud computing platform and $13 billion investment in OpenAI (developer of the famous chatbot ChatGPT). Microsoft Azure's cloud computing business has been rapidly expanding its market share. Azure accounted for a 25% share of global spending on cloud infrastructure services in the third quarter (ended Sept. 30), up from 22% in the same quarter of the prior year. With a global cloud footprint of nearly 60 data center regions and a robust AI infrastructure capable of training and running large language models in real time, Azure has become a major growth catalyst for Microsoft. Its office productivity business is also showing improvement. While the licensing portion of the business is struggling, enterprises are increasingly opting for cloud-based Microsoft 365 subscriptions. Besides popular applications such as Office, PowerPoint, and Excel, companies are also using premium offerings in cybersecurity, analytics, voice, and compliance through Microsoft 365 subscriptions. The Office 365 business saw robust expansion and a rise in average revenue per user (ARPU). The company also expects Microsoft 365 Copilot, an AI assistant integrated into several of the company's offerings such as Office, Outlook, and GitHub, to attract new paid customers and contribute significant revenue in the coming years. Considering these tailwinds, Microsoft seems to be a compelling pick for 2024. Advanced Micro Devices After rallying nearly 120% in 2023, shares of semiconductor company Advanced Micro Devices have declined by around 6% in 2024. This was based on news of the Dutch government partly revoking ASML Holdings' export license for shipping some lithography machines to China. It seems that the semiconductor companies fear the possibility of the Chinese government retaliating by restricting the export of certain metals. While this worry cannot be ignored, there are several reasons to like the stock. First, AMD's EPYC server processors have been a major beneficiary of the rising demand for high-performance computing at data centers. With organizations increasingly migrating to the cloud, there has been growing demand for high-performance and cost-effective third-generation and fourth-generation EPYC processors. Subsequently, AMD's server chips have captured over a 50% share in the North American hyperscaler market. Second, AMD's server chips currently have a mid-teens share in the enterprise market. But with partners such as Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Dell Technologies, and Super Micro Computer expanding their portfolio of AMD products, the company expects more from the enterprise segment in the coming years. Third, AMD expects the data-center AI accelerator market to reach over $400 billion by 2027. To capitalize on this opportunity, the company has launched the MI300 family of chips optimized for AI workloads. The MI300 is competitive with Nvidia's H100 chip in training large language models, but it could prove even better with large language models (running them in a real-time environment) due to its high memory bandwidth. Hence, AMD expects MI300 revenue to surpass $2 billion in fiscal 2024 and is working to ensure a sufficient supply of these chips. Lastly, AMD's investments in developing its software and ecosystem have also helped drive the adoption of its hardware. The company has made strategic acquisitions such as Mipsology and Nod.ai to further enhance its AI software. So even though AMD's current valuation of 9.5 times sales is higher than its three-year average of 8, investors can consider paying this premium to get a piece of the action in this solid growth stock.

"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Over the past year, four stocks with a market capitalization of $200 billion or more (out of 44) had a triple-digit return. Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) stock was one of them, up 114.2% according to Finviz.com. The others are Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), up 237.5%, 178.3%, and 122.1%, respectively. That’s some exclusive company. Care to guess how many of the 44 were down over the past year? Just nine. The worst performer of those in negative territory was Chevron (NYSE:CVX), down 13.1%. How will AMD stock do in 2024? As long as artificial intelligence doesn’t go off the rails like cannabis stocks and crypto have over the past year, I think it will do just fine this year. AMD stock may not see a three-digit increase, but at least a 20-30% rise by Dec. 31. These three things ought to keep Advanced Micro Devices moving higher in 2024. Free Cash Flow and AMD Stock In July 2019, I wrote an article entitled Free Cash Flow Is the Key to Whether or Not Nvidia Stock Is a Buy. In it, I argued that Nvidia’s significant advantage over AMD was its free cash flow (FCF) generation. I expected its fiscal 202o free cash flow to be nearly $3 billion at the time. Meanwhile, AMD’s trailing 12-month free cash flow was -$251 million. “I love companies that generate free cash flow. It’s even better if they can grow FCF by double digits over the long haul. Those that can see their stock prices go higher over time; those that can’t see their stock prices go lower. It’s that simple,” I wrote on July 18, 2019. Fast forward to 2024. AMD’s TTM FCF through Q3 2023 was $1.32 billion. While down from $3.12 billion in 2022, it was still very positive, a far cry from the FCF it used in 2019. Of course, it still pales compared to Nvidia’s TTM FCF of $17.52 billion. The company’s FCF has dropped in the past year as AMD has accelerated its AI investments to meet and beat (well, at least try to) Nvidia’s efforts in this area. So far, this hasn’t translated into cash flow like it has for NVDA. That should change in 2024. The MI300X Could Be Nvidia’s Kryptonite Don’t get me wrong, I’m a big fan of Nvidia and its CEO, Jensen Huang. At the end of November, I suggested that if investors could swing it, they should buy both AMD and NVDA. My rationale was simple. While Nvidia is the two-ton elephant of AI, AMD has moved incredibly quickly to steal some of its thunder, including hiring a top supercomputing expert to take the competition to Huang and company. Earlier in November, I discussed how AMD’s MI300X GPU (graphics processing unit) is one of the best products ever developed, according to CEO Lisa Su. If it can capture 30% of the AI market (leaving 70% for Nvidia), AMD shareholders will still make out like bandits. Su said last June, when it announced the GPU would start shipping later in 2023 (now early in 2024), that the MI300X has 60% more memory than Nvidia’s H100. “What this performance does is it just directly translates into a better user experience,” CNBC reported Su’s Dec. 6 comments. “When you ask a model something, you’d like it to come back faster, especially as responses get more complicated.” That’s not enough to knock Nvidia off its perch, but it’s a start, especially if it can sell its AI chip for less than $40,000, the price for one Nvidia chip. Meta, OpenAI, and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) have all said they will use the M1300X as an alternative to Nvidia’s products. It’s early days, but AMD will likely surprise many people in the tech industry with the success of the MI300X GPU.

"It's a new year, the best time yet to start investing. After all, compounding does its best work late. The sooner you start, the more wealth you'll build over time. One of my favorite aspects of investing is that the stock market doesn't discriminate. You can prosper whether you're already well-off or starting with just $500. Everyone can benefit from owning stocks. Putting pen to paper -- deciding which stocks to own (with thousands to choose from) can be the hardest part of the process. This list is a great reference for those looking for a starting point. Here are five great stocks you can confidently buy for the long term...and $500 will get you at least one share of every stock. 1. Palantir Technologies Software company Palantir Technologies (NYSE: PLTR) hasn't been around long, but it's already made a name on Wall Street. The company builds specialized software for government and enterprise customers on its proprietary platforms. This software helps analyze data and aid in real-time decision-making. Palantir's technology is helping optimize supply chains, detect financial fraud, run military operations, and more. PLTR Total Return Price data by YCharts. The company launched its Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) in 2023, a platform for launching artificial intelligence (AI) models. There's already been tremendous demand, which should bode well for Palantir's long-term growth prospects. The stock has outperformed the market since going public, and that could continue if AI is the investing opportunity it appears to be. 2. Advanced Micro Devices AI requires tremendous computing power, which boils down to the chips that power the computers. Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) has an enormous growth opportunity ahead, even if rival Nvidia has gotten most of the hype. AMD recently announced a new generation of AI chips it claims can outperform Nvidia's core data center product, its H100 series. AMD Total Return Price data by YCharts. AMD's CEO, Lisa Su, believes the AI chip market could hit $400 billion by 2027, setting the company up for solid growth if it can capture a slice of that opportunity. AMD has historically outperformed the broader market as technology advances demand more (and increasingly advanced) chips. Don't overlook AMD as a long-term AI stock. 3. Nike A common investing tip is to buy what you know. Sports apparel giant Nike (NYSE: NKE) is one of the world's most recognizable brands. Sports are a part of global culture, and the company's success in tying its brand to the sporting world's biggest names has fostered years of market-beating growth. Today, Nike has a $165 billion market cap, so blistering returns may be harder to come by simply because of how big the company is. NKE Total Return Price data by YCharts. But don't count the Swoosh out. Nike has evolved, building a blossoming direct-to-consumer business that helps it engage directly with customers and cut out some of the cost of selling through wholesalers. The company's global recognition should help to keep pushing the ball forward in emerging markets like India and China, where consumer spending still has room to grow. 4. Shopify Most people know that Amazon dominates online shopping in the United States. Shopify (NYSE: SHOP) is helping companies worldwide compete with Amazon. The company's software platform makes it simple for merchants to set up and run an online store. Shopify's users range from single entrepreneurs to corporations. Collectively, $56 billion in transactions flowed through Shopify in Q3, so all those shops add up to big business. SHOP Total Return Price data by YCharts. Consumer spending is crucial to the North American economy. In the United States, just 15% of retail is online after decades of growth. In other words, the growth story of e-commerce is nowhere near over. Shopify should continue riding this trend for years, helping millions of businesses compete with the industry's biggest players worldwide. 5. Walt Disney This stock needs little introduction. The Walt Disney Company (NYSE: DIS) is a media behemoth, home to Disney's collection of intellectual property, including Pixar, Star Wars, Marvel, Disney, ESPN, and more. It's leaned on its media to create theme parks, cruise lines, and merchandise found worldwide. Ironically, despite its fame, it's the only stock on this list that hasn't beaten the broader market over its lifetime. DIS Total Return Price data by YCharts. The company began pivoting to streaming, launching Disney+ in 2019. It's been a few challenging years as Disney sought to grow its streaming memberships over making money. With over 100 million households using Disney+, that could begin to change. It's hard not to see Disney's powerful cache of media not creating value for shareholders over the long run.

"The challenging global macroeconomic environment and end-market volatility have affected the Zacks Electronics - Semiconductors industry. Geo-political tensions, unfavorable forex and rising inflationary pressure also weigh heavily on the industry’s prospects. Nevertheless, industry players like Advanced Micro Devices AMD, ASE Technology ASX, Cirrus Logic CRUS and QuickLogic QUIK have been benefiting from the increasing demand for high-volume consumer electronic devices, such as digital media players, smartphones and tablets, and the strong uptake of efficient packaging, machine vision solutions and robotics. Additionally, the growing proliferation of AI, Machine Learning, Blockchain, Internet of Things, Augmented Reality/Virtual Reality (AR/VR) and industrial revolution 4.0 (which focuses on interconnectivity and automation) should continue to drive the industry’s growth. Easing supply-chain constraints are also benefiting the industry participants. Industry Description The Zacks Electronics – Semiconductors industry comprises firms that provide a wide range of semiconductor technologies. Their offerings include packaging and test services, wafer cleaning, factory automation, face detection and image-recognition capabilities to develop intelligent and connected products. The participants primarily cater to end-markets constituting consumer electronics, communications, computing, industrial and automotive. These companies are raising their spending on research and development to stay afloat in an era of technological advancements and changing industry standards. The underlined industry is experiencing solid demand for advanced electronic equipment, helping these firms increase their investments in cost-effective process technologies. What's Shaping the Future of the Electronics - Semiconductors Industry? Macroeconomic Headwinds Pose Concerns: Rising inflationary pressure and fears of global recession have negatively impacted the rate of deal wins. Due to the challenging macroeconomic scenario, enterprises are reluctant to sign multi-year deals worldwide. These trends do not bode well for the industry participants. Geo-political Tensions Are Worrisome: The ongoing Russia-Ukraine war and, most importantly, the souring relationship between the United States and China are creating headwinds. Increasing dependency on AI-backed electronic devices on semiconductors and current restrictions ordered by the United States on trading with China, the main hub for chip production, is a significant negative for the underlined industry. Smart Devices Aiding Computing Demand: Smart devices need computing and learning capabilities to perform face detection, image recognition and video analytics capabilities. These require high processing power, speed and memory; low power consumption; and better graphic processors and solutions, which bode well for the industry. Graphic solutions help increase the image rendering rate, and improve image resolution and color definition. Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bleak Prospects The Zacks Electronics - Semiconductors industry is housed within the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector. It currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #189, which places it in the bottom 25% of more than 250 Zacks industries. The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates solid near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1. The industry’s positioning in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of the negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are pessimistic about this group’s earnings growth potential. Since Sep 30, 2023, the industry’s earnings estimates for the current year have moved 4.2% down. Despite the gloomy industry outlook, a few stocks have the potential to outperform the market based on a strong earnings outlook. But before we present the top industry choices, it is worth taking a look at the industry’s shareholder returns and current valuation first. Industry Outperforms S&P 500 & Sector The Zacks Electronics - Semiconductors industry has outperformed the Zacks S&P 500 composite and surpassed the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector in the past year. The companies in the industry have collectively surged 74.6% compared with the S&P 500 and the broader sector’s rallies of 22% and 45.1%, respectively. One-Year Price Performance Industry's Current Valuation On the basis of the forward 12-month price-to-earnings ratio, which is a commonly used multiple for valuing electronics semiconductors stocks, the industry is currently trading at 25.67X versus the S&P 500 and the sector’s 19.6X and 24.04X, respectively. Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 44.41X, as low as 9.35X and recorded a median of 16.55X, as the chart below shows.

Price and Consensus: CRUS QuickLogic: The San Jose, CA-based company develops ultra-low-power multi-core voice-enabled SoCs, embedded FPGA IP and Endpoint AI solutions. QUIK is gaining from the growing demand for its IP-related products. Strength in its technology and Australis IP generator is noteworthy. A solid momentum in QuickLogic’s Strategic Radiation Hardened FPGA Technology is another major positive.

"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips If you invested in just about any of the big tech stocks earlier last year, chances are you made a decent return by year’s end. The Nasdaq, which tracks many of the major technology equities, rose by 43.4% in 2023, beating all other major indices. Now that we’re in 2024, it’s time to reexamine some of these tech giants and see which ones are poised for massive growth in the coming quarters. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com Last year, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), one of the more prominent fabless CPU and GPU makers in the market, announced how it would tackle the AI market. In particular, during their second-quarter earnings report, the chipmaker finally announced the MI300x GPU chipset, which will compete directly with Nvidia’s A100 and H100 chips used to train LLMs. The chipmaker announced it expects to sell $2 billion in AI chips next year. While, in 2023, AMD’s shares performed somewhat inconsistently due to traders betting on the company’s long-awaited AI chips but at the same time bearing worries about the slowing PC market, AMD’s stock more than doubled and could be on its way to another great year. 2024 will have to be the year AMD proves it can compete with Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) in churning out high-performance chips for large language models (LLMs) and data centers. AMD has definitely overcome competitors as an underdog, and it would not surprise me if the chipmaker did it again. CrowdStrike (CRWD) Source: Michael Vi / Shutterstock CrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) is a cybersecurity firm on the rise, and the company has undoubtedly come a long way. According to IDC, CrowdStrike was the largest player in the Worldwide Endpoint Security market in 2022, even outpacing Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). CrowdStrike specializes in cloud-based endpoint protection and threat intelligence services. The company’s comprehensive platform leverages artificial intelligence, behavioral analytics, and threat intelligence to detect and prevent breaches. CrowdStrike’s shares have climbed more than 140% by the end of 2023. The stock’s market cap currently exceeds $62 billion. As the company continues to leverage AI in its endpoint security products, CrowdStrike could attract more customers and grow its business. Multiple earnings beats in 2023 show CrowdStrike’s solutions were in demand despite a volatile macro-environment. Many enterprises have cybersecurity at the forefront of their digital transformation efforts and uncertainty in the economy is less likely to upend those plans. CrowdStrike has much to benefit from here. Meta Platforms (META) Source: Chinnapong / Shutterstock.com Having a massive user base of nearly 4.0 billion monthly active users across its family of apps including Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is the third company on this list that is ready for massive growth. The number of cumulative users alone gives Meta an impressive edge in building out and testing its novel social media endeavor. Today, Meta Platforms has focused on pioneering contemporary metaverse conceptualization. While Meta had certainly dipped its toes in virtual reality (VR) in the past, lately the social media giant has plowed more capital into Facebook Reality Labs, a research division that develops cutting-edge technologies for augmented reality, haptics, and neural interfaces. Operational efficiencies and decent revenue growth brought Meta a very profitable Q3 2023. This can also prepare the company to focus resources on its most innovative products, which could catapult the company into an era of renewed growth.

"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips The artificial intelligence (AI) boom shows no signs of cooling, creating significant opportunity for AI stocks. First, we have to consider tech heavyweights that are investing billions into it. Next, analysts at Next Move Strategy Consulting say the AI market, currently valued at about $100 billion, could grow twenty-fold by 2030 to more than $2 trillion. Finally, according to analysts at UBS, “If the launch of the ChatGPT application is the iPhone moment for the AI industry, the recent rollouts of numerous applications like copilots and features like Turbo and vision from OpenAI in 4Q23 mean the App Store moment for the AI industry has arrived, in our view,” as noted by Business Insider. Therefore, some of the top AI stocks are trading at a temporary discount. So, let’s explore them next. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com Considering recent weakness in AI stocks, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is an opportunity. For one, it’s technically attractive. After slipping from about $150 to $133, the tech stock appears to have caught strong support. From its current price of $138.58, I’d like to see it initially retest $150, and eventually run to $200. Also, AMD is a massive player in the AI market, especially with its new MI300X accelerator chip. That is expected to generate about $2 billion in revenue this year. Further, high-demand for AI chips should fuel a greater significant upside in tech stocks, like AMD. Even better, UBS analysts still have AMD listed as a top pick in the semiconductor space for the year. Also, analysts at Truist raised their price target on AMD to $154 from $98. Mizuho analysts raised their price target to $162 from $130, with a buy rating, as well. Qualcomm (QCOM) Source: nikkimeel / Shutterstock.com Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) could see higher highs, too. After running from about $105 to a high of $146.89, QCOM did pull back recently, finding support at $135. From here, I’d like to see it retest that prior high and potentially head back to $150. Also, the company recently unveiled its Snapdragon 7 Gen 3. QCOM notes that its components “deliver across-the-board advancements to ignite on-device AI,” as quoted by Engagdet.com. Analysts like QCOM at current prices, too. For example, Mizuho just raised its price target to $155 from $140. Also, Bernstein analysts raised their price target to $160 from 145, with an outperform rating. “Qualcomm is pioneering AI-enabled chip technology, a move set to revolutionize mobile computing,” as noted by Investorplace contributor Muslim Farooque. “Despite earlier challenges from sluggish phone sales and reduced 5G investment, the company’s rebound, backed by solid earnings, signifies market stabilization and resilience.” Global X Robotics & Artificial Intelligence ETF (BOTZ) Global X Funds logo. (PRNewsFoto/Global X Funds) Or, maybe diversification among top AI names is best for you. At less cost, you can always invest in an ETF like the Global X Robotics & Artificial Intelligence ETF (NASDAQ:BOTZ). After slipping from about $28.50 to $26.84, the ETF appears to have caught strong support. In fact, it could rally higher from here. From its current price of $26.84, I’d like to see it initially test $31 a share. With an expense ratio of 0.69%, the ETF invests in companies that could benefit from increased utilization of robotics and artificial intelligence (AI). And, that includes those involved with industrial robotics and automation, non-industrial robots, and autonomous vehicles. Some of its top holdings include Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ:ISRG), C3.ai (NYSE:AI), and Upstart (NASDAQ:UPST) to name a few of the top ones. The nice thing about an ETF, such as BOTZ, is that you’ll pay less for greater exposure. For example, one share of BOTZ will cost you $26.84. If you wanted 100 shares, it’s $2,684. Or, you can buy one share of NVDA for $491, or $49,100 for 100 shares. On the date of publication, Ian Cooper did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned.

"By Chuck Mikolajczak NEW YORK, Jan 8 (Reuters) - The Nasdaq scored its first gain of at least 1% in 2024 on Monday, as a fall in Treasury yields helped lift megacap stocks, while a sharp drop in Boeing shares kept gains on the Dow Industrials in check. Megacaps advanced, lifting stocks such as Amazon.com AMZN.O which closed up 2.66% and Alphabet GOOGL.O, which rose 2.29%, as Treasury yields fell ahead of readings on inflation and a new supply of government debt this week, with the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yield US10YT=R hitting a low of 3.966% on the session. In addition, Apple AAPL.O climbed 2.42% after the iPhone maker said its Vision Pro mixed-reality device will be available for sale from Feb. 2 in the United States. Nvidia NVDA.O surged 6.3% and fellow chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices AMD.O jumped 5.48%, helping to push the Philadelphia SE Semiconductor Index .SOX up 3.28% as it bounced from a 5.8% drop last week, its biggest weekly percentage fall since October 2022. ""This is definitely a yield-driven market for now and investors are trying to discount when and how many rate cuts we will see, the timing and the magnitude of rate cuts,"" said Bill Merz, head of capital markets research at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Minneapolis. ""Now we're probably in a more rational place in terms of yields and it's a question of, is the market getting that right and are yields falling for the right reasons or the wrong reasons? And investors have so far taken the view that yields are falling for all the right reasons, that the Fed is navigating what thus far has been a soft landing."" The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 216.90 points, or 0.58%, to 37,683.01, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 66.30 points, or 1.41 %, to 4,763.54 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC gained 319.70 points, or 2.20%, to 14,843.77. The gains on the Nasdaq and S&P 500 marked their first daily percentage climbs of more than 1% since Dec. 21 and biggest one-day percentage advances since Nov. 14. Meanwhile, Boeing BA.N shares plunged 8.03% after the plane maker and U.S. regulators gave the go-ahead on Monday for airlines to inspect jets that were grounded after a panel blew off an Alaska Airlines-operated ALK.N 737 MAX 9 in mid-flight which forced a dramatic landing of the airliner over the weekend. The S&P 500 energy index .SPNY was the sole decliner among the 11 S&P 500 sectors, falling 1.16% after hitting its lowest level in a month as crude prices sank about 4% after sharp price cuts by top exporter Saudi Arabia and a rise in OPEC output. On Friday, the benchmark S&P 500 .SPX snapped a nine-week streak of gains, as investors dialed back expectations on the possible aggressiveness of the Federal Reserve in cutting interest rates this year following a mixed bag of economic data on the labor market and services sector. Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic said on Monday that the central bank's dual goals of lowering inflation and maintaining low unemployment are not yet in conflict. Money markets now see a 63.8% chance of at least a 25 basis-point (bps) rate cut as soon as March, according to CME's FedWatch Tool, down from 88.5% a week ago. Investors will eye inflation data this week in the form of the consumer price index (CPI) and producer price index (PPI) to shape expectations for the path of interest rates by the Fed. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 3-to-1 ratio on the NYSE while on the Nasdaq, advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 2.3-to-1 ratio. The S&P 500 posted 13 new 52-week highs and no new lows while the Nasdaq recorded 101 new highs and 92 new lows.

"By Johann M Cherian and Ankika Biswas Jan 8 (Reuters) - Tech-laden Nasdaq jumped more than 1% to a near one-week high on Monday, boosted by a rebound in megacaps and chip stocks, while blue-chip index Dow slipped to a fresh two-week low as Boeing shares tanked following the grounding of some its jets. Megacaps like Amazon.com AMZN.O and Alphabet GOOGL.O gained over 1%, while AppleAAPL.O climbed 1.4% after saying its Vision Pro mixed-reality device will be available for sale from Feb. 2 in the United States.

""We do think the gains (in megacaps) will be sustainable after last year's outperformance,"" said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer at Independent Advisor Alliance. ""A lot of investors have been drawn to the mega caps because they are profit machines and in good times, they do really well."" Meanwhile, BoeingBA.N slid 6.6% after the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) ordered the temporary grounding of some 737 MAX 9 jets fitted with a panel that blew off an Alaska Air Group ALK.N jet in midair on Friday. The aircraft manufacturer could lose about $10 billion in value if losses hold through market close. Energy stocks .SPNY led declines among the 11 S&P 500 sectors, dropping by 2.1% to a three-week low as crude prices sank over 4% after sharp price cuts by top exporter Saudi Arabia and a rise in OPEC output.

On Friday, the benchmark S&P 500 .SPX marked its worst week since late October, after mixed economic data turned investors cautious and prompted them to scale back expectations on when the Federal Reserve could begin rate cuts. Remarks by Atlanta's Raphael Bostic, a Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) voting member this year, due at 12:30 p.m. ET, will be parsed for his stance on monetary policy easing. Over the weekend, Dallas' Lorie Logan warned the Fed may need to resume raising its short-term policy rate. Money markets now see a 69.5% chance of at least a 25-basis-point (bps) rate cut as early as March, down from over 85% in the final weeks of 2023, according to the CME FedWatch Tool. Investors were also awaiting December consumer and producer inflation reports later in the week and commentary by several policymakers for clues on the Fed's monetary policy trajectory. JPMorgan Chase JPM.N, Wells Fargo WFC.N, Bank of America BAC.N and Citigroup C.N are set to kick off the quarterly earnings season on Friday. Their shares were down over 1% each.

"Hype around artificial intelligence (AI) rocked the markets in 2023, sending the tech-heavy Nasdaq soaring more than 40%. The megacap Magnificent Seven stocks were at the epicenter of AI mania, and perhaps their most influential member is semiconductor manufacturer Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). The company saw its market cap balloon in 2023, and it joined Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet in the exclusive $1 trillion market-cap club. It's no surprise that Wall Street analyst Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities crowned Nvidia as the godfather of AI. After surging 237% last year, some might think now is the time for profit taking. But what if I told you that Nvidia stock could be undervalued? Let's explore how the company is leading the charge in AI, and why now might be as good a time as ever to scoop up some shares. Demand is off the charts Nvidia has developed a host of graphics processing units (GPUs). The bedrocks of its GPU line are the A100 and H100 chips, the latter of which is experiencing unprecedented demand. NVDA revenue (quarterly) data by YCharts. The chart above illustrates Nvidia's quarterly revenue during the past decade. The big takeaway is that the slope of the line really steepens starting in 2023. For the third quarter of the company's fiscal 2024, ended Oct. 29, Nvidia reported a record $18.1 billion in revenue, an increase of more than 200% year over year. Moreover, the company's profit increased nearly 500% through the first three quarters of its fiscal year. If this wasn't enough to get your attention, consider that Wall Street is forecasting revenue to rise 54% this fiscal year, followed by another 20% the year after. Although this technically shows decelerating revenue, I'd say that is appropriate. It's unrealistic for investors to expect triple-digit percentage revenue growth in perpetuity. Moreover, while Nvidia dominates the AI application market for data center GPUs, there are other competitors gaining steam. NVDA revenue estimates for current fiscal year, data by YCharts. With 2024 looking like another milestone year for Nvidia, investors might be wondering how attractive the stock is from a valuation perspective. Image Source: Getty Images Nvidia's valuation looks tempting As of the time of this writing, the stock trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 24.8. By comparison, the company's top competitor, Advanced Micro Devices, trades at a forward P/E of 37. While AMD is making progress of its own, it is far behind Nvidia. Considering Nvidia's growth relative to AMD, fueled by its dominant market share in AI data center GPUs, the disparity between valuation multiples is a head-scratcher. On top of that, the forward P/E of the S&P 500 is 21.7 -- not too far behind Nvidia. Given the company's stellar performance in 2023 and its strong outlook for this year, it's hard to see why Nvidia doesn't carry a higher premium. My hunch is that investors are acting with more emotion than logic when it comes to Nvidia. The stock's performance throughout 2023 and the company's admission to the $1 trillion market-cap club might give off vibes of an expensive stock. However, the multiples above could suggest that Nvidia is growing into its valuation, and the stock could actually be cheap. I think Nvidia will continue to benefit from the secular tailwinds of AI, and now looks like a terrific time to begin dollar-cost averaging into a long-term position at a bargain. Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?

"After a rocky start to the year, semiconductor stocks are turning around in a big way on Monday. During the first week of 2024, some of the world's most famous semiconductor companies -- Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE: TSM), Intel (NASDAQ: INTC), and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) -- declined in the wake of December's Santa Claus rally. As the stock market started to find its footing in the second week, however, shares of all three of these companies flipped from sinking to rising. As of 12:05 p.m. ET, TSMC shares were up 2.9%, Intel stock was up a solid 3.4%, and AMD was doing the best of all with a 5.1% gain. You can probably thank President Joe Biden for that. Bad news for China is good news for everyone else By now, you've certainly heard about the Biden administration's plans to curtail China's access to some of the most advanced chips available to support artificial intelligence functions. That section of the market is dominated by Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), which has been feeling the lion's share of the impact from export restrictions on those types of chips. Other companies have been little affected. However, The Wall Street Journal reported Monday morning that the Biden administration is now shifting its attention to less advanced, older-generation computer chips used in industries other than AI -- in consumer electronics, military weapons, and cars, for example. These kinds of semiconductor chips are more likely to be produced in and exported from China rather than imported into China. Indeed, as the WSJ article highlights, China is downright dominant in this segment of the semiconductor industry -- and President Biden wants to do something about that. Meanwhile, worrying that China might leverage its dominant position in lower-end chips to punish the U.S. in a future trade war, Congress has been urging the Commerce Department and U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) to take steps to protect the supply chain for these chips by awarding subsidies to expand domestic semiconductor production on the one hand and imposing tariffs on chips imported from China on the other. What this means for Intel, Taiwan Semi, and AMD This effort is still in its early days, but already, the WSJ notes that the Commerce Department has awarded $162 million in subsidies to help Microchip Technology expand production of microcontrollers for cars and appliances. The Commerce Department is also said to be putting together a list of other U.S. companies that might receive government support to counter China's rapidly growing industry producing lower-end chips. Don't get too excited just yet. While Intel, Taiwan Semi, and AMD stocks are all rising on Monday's news, there's no guarantee that any of these companies will end up getting subsidies directly aimed at supporting their lower-end chip production. To the contrary, semiconductor companies like Marvell, Texas Instruments, and Microchip all spring to mind more readily when one thinks of lower-end chips. And all of those stocks are rising Monday, too. That said, if you did want to place a bet on one of the high-profile chipmakers named above based on this newest effort to subsidize domestic chip production, Taiwan Semiconductor looks like the safest bet to make. Trading at less than 16 times forward earnings, it's significantly cheaper than Intel at 26 times forward earnings -- and less than half the price of AMD at 37 times forward earnings. TSMC is also trading at a cheaper valuation than Marvell, TI, or Microchip. Strange as it may be to say it, Taiwan Semiconductor may end up being the biggest beneficiary of all if the U.S. trade war in semiconductor chips continues.

"By Johann M Cherian and Ankika Biswas Jan 8 (Reuters) - Blue-chip index Dow slipped to a fresh two-week low on Monday as Boeing shares nosedived following the grounding of some its jets, while a rebound in megacaps and chip stocks supported the other U.S. stock indexes. BoeingBA.N slid 9.1% after the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) ordered the temporary grounding of some 737 MAX 9 jets fitted with a panel that blew off an Alaska Air Group ALK.N jet in midair on Friday. The aircraft manufacturer could lose about $13.5 billion in value if losses hold through market close. ""It could impact the airline sector because the 737 (MAX) is a real workhorse of the many airlines fleets,"" said Kim Forrest, chief investment officer at Bokeh Capital Partners. ""So it's a drag and a real black mark on Boeing and the company has to come out strongly and say how they're fixing this and how it's not going to happen again."" Alaska Air GroupALK.N slumped 3.9% after the carrier canceled more than 200 flights following the FAA order. On Friday, the benchmark S&P 500 .SPXmarked its worst week since late October, after mixed economic data turned investors cautious and prompted them to scale back expectations on when the Federal Reserve could begin rate cuts. Remarks by Atlanta's Raphael Bostic, a Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) voting member this year, due at 12:30 p.m. ET, will be parsed for his stance on monetary policy easing. That comes after Dallas' Lorie Logan warned over the weekend the Fed may need to resume raising its short-term policy rate. Money markets now see a 64.7% chance of at least a 25-basis-point (bps) rate cut as early as March, down from over 85% in the final weeks of 2023, according to the CME FedWatch Tool. Investors were also awaiting two December inflation reports later in the week and commentary by several policymakers for clues on the Fed's monetary policy trajectory. Among the 11 S&P 500 sectors, energy .SPNY led declines with a 2.8% loss as crude prices sank nearly 5%. O/R At 9:52 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI was down 185.79 points, or 0.50%, at 37,280.32, the S&P 500 .SPX was up 11.73 points, or 0.25%, at 4,708.97, and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC was up 104.25 points, or 0.72%, at 14,628.33. AppleAAPL.O climbed 0.9% after saying its Vision Pro mixed-reality device will be available for sale from Feb. 2 in the United States. Amazon.com AMZN.O and Alphabet GOOGL.O added 1.1% and 0.5% respectively. JPMorgan Chase JPM.N, Wells Fargo WFC.N, Bank of America BAC.N and Citigroup C.N lost more than 1% ahead of reporting quarterly earnings on Friday. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 1.20-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and by a 1.05-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.

"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock surged throughout 2023, but has been sliding as investors take some risk off the table by taking profit. Investors can make prudent moves, but their necessity is questionable. The market may have overreacted to anticipated lower interest rates. Despite the company’s impressive performance in 2023, there are indications that growth may slow down more than expected. A surface-level assessment may be causing concerns, but a closer look can change your perspective. NVDA Stock and the Market’s Current Stance Plenty talk about Nvidia’s outsized impact on the broad market’s performance, but it’s not fully a one-way street. Factors that affect overall market sentiment can make a big impact on NVDA’s price performance. Right now, that would be the uncertainty surrounding the future direction of interest rates. Still, while macro-related uncertainty is playing a role, arguably, it’s been more company-specific areas of uncertainty having the largest effect NVDA stock. For months, the U.S. government’s crackdown on chip exports to China has affected sentiment for Nvidia. There are concerns about how this crackdown, and the resultant bans, will affect the company’s future growth. Since last month, Advanced Micro Devices‘ (NASDAQ:AMD) AI chip product launches, plus Intel’s (NASDAQ:INTC) generative AI chip unveiling, have raised concerns related to rising competition and its impact on Nvidia’s growth. While these China and competition-based concerns haven’t shifted sentiment for NVDA from bullish to bearish, they have clearly made some investors hesitant to buy, and have compelled other investors to exit/pare down positions. Again, though, while the overall market is feeling uneasy, that doesn’t mean you need to follow suit. There’s Still a Path to New Highs in 2024 As discussed in prior coverage of NVDA stock, China-related concerns shouldn’t scare you away. Nvidia has figured how to both work around and mitigate the impact of the export bans. When it comes to the most recent non-macro concern about NVDA (rising competition), there’s a lot out there that should assuage your concerns. AMD and Intel could keep making progress (and generate big profits) from capitalizing on the generative AI mega-trend. Still, their success isn’t likely to come at Nvidia’s expensemin the immediate future. While gaining ground, AMD and Intel remain well behind this AI chip frontrunner. According to Srini Pajjuri of Raymond James, Nvidia is projected to hold an 85% share of the AI accelerator chip market this fiscal year (ending January 2025). Nvidia will meet or surpass growth expectations despite competition. In fact, given how NVDA trades for only 24.1 times forward consensus estimates for FY2025 earnings ($19.88 per share, up by around 62.3%), merely meeting expectations may be enough to drive the stock to even loftier price levels in 2024. Here’s how. The Verdict: New Highs Are Well Within Reach At some point in time, the AI chip market will inevitably mature. However, it’s an understatement to say that moment is years away from arriving. It may just well be decades away from arriving. In the near-to-medium term, demand for AI accelerators and processors will stay robust and continue to climb. As the dominant name in the space, this points to continued outsized earnings growth for Nvidia. This leaves the stock poised to move higher, in a big way. Shares will move higher in line with increased earnings, but also (most likely), thanks to multiple expansion. Once Nvidia shows that it’s not exiting the fast lane just yet, shares could re-rate to a forward earnings multiple in the 30-40 range. With this, hitting $600, $700, or even $800 per share this year isn’t out of reach for NVDA stock. NVDA stock earns an A rating in Portfolio Grader.

"By Chuck Mikolajczak NEW YORK, Jan 8 (Reuters) - The Nasdaq closed with a gain of at least 1% for the first time in 2024 on Monday, as a fall in Treasury yields helped lift megacap stocks, while a sharp drop in Boeing shares kept gains on the Dow Industrials in check. Megacaps such as Amazon.com AMZN.O and Alphabet GOOGL.O gained as Treasury yields fell ahead of readings on inflation and a new supply of government debt this week, with the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yield US10YT=R hitting a low of 3.966% on the session. In addition, Apple AAPL.O also advanced after the iPhone maker said its Vision Pro mixed-reality device will be available for sale from Feb. 2 in the United States. Chipmakers Nvidia NVDA.O and Advanced Micro Devices AMD.O surged and the Philadelphia SE Semiconductor Index .SOX ended up around 3% after dropping 5.8% last week, its biggest weekly percentage fall since October 2022. ""This is definitely a yield-driven market for now and investors are trying to discount when and how many rate cuts we will see, the timing and the magnitude of rate cuts,"" said Bill Merz, head of capital markets research at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Minneapolis. ""Now we're probably in a more rational place in terms of yields and it's a question of, is the market getting that right and are yields falling for the right reasons or the wrong reasons? And investors have so far taken the view that yields are falling for all the right reasons, that the Fed is navigating what thus far has been a soft landing."" According to preliminary data, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 66.19 points, or 1.41%, to end at 4,763.51 points, while the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC gained 319.70 points, or 2.20%, to 14,843.77. The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 216.44 points, or 0.58%, to 37,682.55. The S&P 500 energy index .SPNY was the sole decliner among the 11 S&P 500 sectors after hitting its lowest level in a month as crude prices sank about 4% after sharp price cuts by top exporter Saudi Arabia and a rise in OPEC output. On Friday, the benchmark S&P 500 .SPX snapped a nine-week streak of gains, as investors dialed back expectations on how aggressive the Federal Reserve would be in cutting interest rates this year following a mixed bag of economic data on the labor market and services sector. Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic said on Monday that the central bank's dual goals of lowering inflation and maintaining low unemployment are not yet in conflict. Money markets now see a 63.8% chance of at least a 25 basis-point (bps) rate cut as soon as March, according to CME's FedWatch Tool, down from 88.5% a week ago. Investors will eye inflation data this week in the form of the consumer price index (CPI) and producer price index (PPI) to shape expectations for the path of interest rates by the Fed.

"The trillion-dollar club is certainly rarified air, and one that every company aspires to join. Investors, of course, aspire to find the next candidate with the potential to join such elite company. Odds are, every company that has reached that milestone has made many fortunes for investors along the way. Case in point: Artificial intelligence (AI) chip star Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) began 2023 at just a $350 billion market cap, but has more than tripled since, reaching a market cap today exceeding $1.2 trillion! So, where to find the next big winner? It may not be surprising that I think the AI revolution could mint even more trillion-dollar companies, like this key Nvidia rival. Can Advanced Micro Devices catch up? Given the explosive growth in AI computing we are seeing and are likely to see through this decade, those tailwinds could potentially propel Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) to new heights. That is, of course, only true if the company executes. But AMD's execution has been excellent ever since Lisa Su took over as CEO in October 2014. Back then, AMD had just a $2.4 billion market cap -- yes, you read that right. Fast forward to today, and AMD's market cap has gone up nearly one hundred times under her tenure, to $223 billion. AMD Market Cap data by YCharts How did AMD do it? As is usually the case, a lot of skill, planning, and a little bit of luck. First, Su made the choice to diversify away from PCs, where AMD got 90% of its revenue at the time, and into more high-end applications such as gaming, embedded chips, and data center processors. Second, Su used the 2017 transition to FinFet transistors to attempt to catch up to market leader Intel in process technology. At the time, Intel had a near-monopoly on the processor market and leading technology. AMD practically existed just so many customers would have a secondary option for cheap processors and keep Intel from having 100% of the market. But as chipmaking became more complex, with FinFets and the 7-nanometer process node, Intel stumbled. Meanwhile, AMD's foundry partner Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) excelled and pulled ahead of Intel on leading-edge chipmaking. That left an opportunity for AMD to actually leap ahead of Intel in terms of power and performance, enabling it to gobble up market share from a near-zero starting point. Can AMD pull off the same feat in artificial intelligence chips? Given that AMD was able to meet and overtake a large and dominant rival in PC processors, can the company do it again with AI accelerators? While Nvidia has a big lead in that area today, AMD introduced its challenger MI300 line of AI accelerators in June 2023. The MI300, unlike the all-in-one die that hosts Nvidia's H100, is made up of a ""chiplet"" architecture consisting of 12 chiplets. That architecture allows for some advantages, including a whopping 153 billion transistors, with the ability to handle 192 gigabytes of HBM3 memory. That compares with the H100's ""mere"" 80 billion transistors and just 80GB of HBM memory capacity. In light of these specs, AMD certainly has a shot at getting some looks from AI customers, especially those with memory-hungry applications. No wonder Su has said she expects at least $2 billion in revenue for the MI300 accelerators in 2024, despite just ramping production recently. Can AMD compete with Nvidia in AI? Image source: AMD. But Nvidia should still remain a leader for the foreseeable future While the MI300 exceeds the H100 on certain specs, investors shouldn't expect AMD to match Nvidia any time soon. One important difference is that the MI300 doesn't have the transformer engine of the H100, which can be turned on to triple the H100's performance. That would, of course, shorten the time to train large language models, and could keep customers in the H100 for the most pressing applications. Another advantage for Nvidia is that it will already be coming out with the H200 in the second quarter, and will move on to an entirely new architecture, the B100, next fall/winter. In October 2023, Nvidia announced that it would move from a two-year cadence to a one-year cadence for new AI chip architectures. Given that AMD is just ramping the MI300 now, it will actually be competing more with these newer chips than with the H100. And since Nvidia is now going into turbo-speed, it may be hard for AMD to eventually catch up. This is especially true because Nvidia also uses TSMC as its foundry, so Nvidia will likely not stumble in the way Intel did five years ago. If TSMC stumbles, both Nvidia and AMD would suffer together. In addition, Nvidia has been developing its CUDA software stack since 2006, and has achieved a nice network effect with developers. AMD is quickly developing its own quasi-open-source software stack called RocM, which it's piecing together from its own research and development combined with several recent acquisitions last year. Still, a 15-year-plus head start will be difficult to overcome quickly. But $1 trillion is still in sight by 2030 Even if AMD forever remains a ""next-best"" option for AI chips, it's possible the AI market could be large enough that AMD will reach $1 trillion anyway. After all, at its December 2023 presentation, Su increased her projection for the AI chip market from $150 billion to $400 billion by 2027. While some of that increase comes from chips for ""AI PCs,"" the good news is that AMD will potentially have an even better chance at leading that market, considering its strong position in PCs today. AMD hit $24 billion in revenue in 2022 before the PC downturn caused a slight dip this year. But even an incremental 10% of the $400 billion AI chip market could propel AMD's revenue to, say, $65 billion by 2027. Assuming a 30% net income margin, that could yield $20 billion in earnings. So a price-to-earnings multiple of 50 could get AMD to a $1 trillion market cap by that time. That may seem like a high valuation, but it's a pretty good bet that the AI chip market will continue growing beyond 2027. It's also quite possible AMD could get more than that modest 10% share of the AI chip market. So by 2030, it's certainly a fair shot to get to that $1 trillion market cap, more than four times today's valuation. Should you invest $1,000 in Advanced Micro Devices right now?

"TOKYO, Jan 9 (Reuters) - Japan's Nikkei share average hit its highest level since March 1990 on Tuesday, as investors snapped up chip-related stocks tracking an overnight Wall Street rally in technology shares. The Nikkei .N225 was up 1.44% at 33858.63 by the mid-day break, after hitting a 33-year high of 33990.28 earlier. Of the 225 stocks on the index, 151 advanced. The broader Topix index .TOPX was up 0.93%. Chip-related stocks, which tend to move the benchmark, led the Nikkei's rise after chipmakers Nvidia NVDA.O and Advanced Micro Devices AMD.O surged on Wall Street overnight. .N Tokyo Electron 8035.T and Advantest 6857.T, up 4.27% and 7.06% respectively, combined were pushing the index up around 200 points. Nintendo 7974.T also made the top performers in the morning session, extending recent gains to move up 4.22%, as news swirled that the company might release a new game console this year. DeNA 2432.T led the pack, gaining 7.83%, after making an after-market announcement on Friday it would commence preparations to list shares for an equity-method affiliate company. The Nikkei clocked its best year in a decade in 2023, aided by expectations of better governance. After an initial pullback to start 2024, the Nikkei rallied an additional 1.6% from last year's final trading day to hit Tuesday's peak since Japan's asset price bubble burst in 1989. ""I think a correction may not come as soon as next week or this week, but I'm a bit cautious, if not a little bit pessimistic over the near term"" over the next few months, as markets assess the latest policy decisions by the Fed and Bank of Japan, said Naka Matsuzawa, chief macro strategist at Nomura. Meanwhile, energy shares were among the worst performers, after oil prices fell about 4% on Monday on sharp price cuts by top exporter Saudi Arabia.

"U.S. stock markets closed sharply higher on Monday after finishing the first week of 2024 in red. Technology stocks rebounded following a decline in the yield of U.S. government bond yield. However, the time when the Fed will initiate first interest rate cut remained uncertain. All three major stock indexes ended in positive territory. How Did The Benchmarks Perform? The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) was up 0.6% or 216.9 points to close at 37,683.01. At intraday low, the blue-chip index was down nearly 217 points. Notably, 23 components of the 30-stock index ended in positive territory, while 7 ended in negative zone. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite finished at 14,843.77 or 319.70 points, jumping 2.2% due to strong performance of large-cap technology stocks. Tech behemoths like CrowdStrike Holdings Inc. CRWD and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. AMD, advanced 5.5% and 5.4%, respectively. CrowdStrike Holdings currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. The S&P 500 climbed 1.4% to finish at 4,763.54. Seven out of 10 broad sectors of the broad-market index ended in positive territory while one in negative zone. The Communication Services Select Sector SPDR (XLC), the Technology Select Sector SPDR (XLK) and the Consumer Discretionary Select SPDR (XLY) and the Real Estate Select Sector SPDR (XLRE) advanced 1.6%, 2.5%, 1.7% and 1.4%, respectively. On the other hand, the Energy Select Sector SPDR (XLE) decline 1.6%. The fear-gauge CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) was down 2% to 13.08. Advancers outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by a 3-to-1 ratio. On Nasdaq, a 2.3-to-1 ratio favored advancing issues. The S&P 500 posted 13 new highs and no new lows while the Nasdaq recorded 101 new highs and 92 new lows. U.S. Economy Cooling The Institute of Supply Management (ISM) reported that the manufacturing Index for December came in at 47.4, marginally ahead of the consensus estimate of 47.2. The reading for November was 46.7. Any reading below 50 indicates a contraction in manufacturing activities. December marked the 14th consecutive month of manufacturing contraction after 28th months of expansion. The new orders Index remained in contraction territory at 47.1, lower than November’s reading of 48.3. The ISM also reported that the services Index for December came in at 50.6, reflecting the 12th consecutive months of expansion. Any reading above 50 indicates an expansion in services activities. However, the metric was lower than November’s data of 52.7 and the consensus estimate of 52.5. The sub index for new orders came in at 52.8 in December compared with 55.5 in November. The sub index for employment contracted to 43.3 in December from 50.7 in November. December’s data was the lowest since May 2020. Labor Market Remains Resilient The Department of Labor reported that the U.S. economy added 216,000 jobs in December, beating the consensus estimate of 170,000. However, the metric for November was revised downward to 173,000 from 199,000. The unemployment rate in December was 3.7%, flat month over month but below the consensus estimate of 3.8%. The average hourly wage rate increased 0.4% in December, flat with November but higher than the consensus estimate of 0.3%. Year over year, the wage rate increased 4.1% in December, beating the consensus estimate of 3.9%. Uncertainty on Rate Cut Market participants remained clueless when the Fed will initiate first rate cut. Federal Reserve Governor Michelle Bowman said that she believes rate hike cycle is over. However, she is not yet convinced that the economy is in proper shape to initiate interest rate cut anytime soon. 5 Stocks Set to Double Each was handpicked by a Zacks expert as the #1 favorite stock to gain +100% or more in 2023.

"The iShares Semiconductor ETF (SOXX) was launched on 07/10/2001, and is a smart beta exchange traded fund designed to offer broad exposure to the Technology ETFs category of the market. What Are Smart Beta ETFs? The ETF industry has long been dominated by products based on market cap weighted indexes, a strategy created to reflect the market or a particular market segment. Market cap weighted indexes offer a low-cost, convenient, and transparent way of replicating market returns, and are a good option for investors who believe in market efficiency. However, some investors believe in the possibility of beating the market through exceptional stock selection, and choose a different type of fund that tracks non-cap weighted strategies: smart beta. Based on specific fundamental characteristics, or a combination of such, these indexes attempt to pick stocks that have a better chance of risk-return performance. The smart beta space gives investors many different choices, from equal-weighting, one of the simplest strategies, to more complicated ones like fundamental and volatility/momentum based weighting. However, not all of these methodologies have been able to deliver remarkable returns. Fund Sponsor & Index The fund is managed by Blackrock, and has been able to amass over $9.93 billion, which makes it one of the largest ETFs in the Technology ETFs. SOXX, before fees and expenses, seeks to match the performance of the PHLX SOX Semiconductor Sector Index. The ICE Semiconductor Index measures the performance of U.S. traded securities of companies engaged in the semiconductor business. Cost & Other Expenses Investors should also pay attention to an ETF's expense ratio. Lower cost products will produce better results than those with a higher cost, assuming all other metrics remain the same. Operating expenses on an annual basis are 0.35% for SOXX, making it one of the least expensive products in the space. It's 12-month trailing dividend yield comes in at 0.81%. Sector Exposure and Top Holdings Even though ETFs offer diversified exposure that minimizes single stock risk, investors should also look at the actual holdings inside the fund. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis. Representing 100% of the portfolio, the fund has heaviest allocation to the Information Technology sector. Taking into account individual holdings, Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD) accounts for about 9.48% of the fund's total assets, followed by Broadcom Inc (AVGO) and Intel Corporation Corp (INTC). SOXX's top 10 holdings account for about 59.63% of its total assets under management. Performance and Risk So far this year, SOXX has lost about -2.88%, and was up about 55.09% in the last one year (as of 01/09/2024). During this past 52-week period, the fund has traded between $373.83 and $581.45. The ETF has a beta of 1.37 and standard deviation of 34.63% for the trailing three-year period, making it a high risk choice in the space. With about 35 holdings, it has more concentrated exposure than peers. Alternatives IShares Semiconductor ETF is an excellent option for investors seeking to outperform the Technology ETFs segment of the market. There are other ETFs in the space which investors could consider as well. SPDR S&P Semiconductor ETF (XSD) tracks S&P Semiconductor Select Industry Index and the VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH) tracks MVIS US Listed Semiconductor 25 Index. SPDR S&P Semiconductor ETF has $1.42 billion in assets, VanEck Semiconductor ETF has $11.67 billion. XSD has an expense ratio of 0.35% and SMH charges 0.35%. Investors looking for cheaper and lower-risk options should consider traditional market cap weighted ETFs that aim to match the returns of the Technology ETFs.
